       The FINN fire_emis utility creates global gridded fire emissions files
       from the original FINN files of emissions for individual fires.  The 
       resulting files are named emissions_<spcname>_<resol>.nc, where:

           <spcname> is an output species name
                     (see "glb2fire_map" in the "Namelist control variables" section below)
           <resol>   is the horizontal resolution of the output
                     (see "resol" in the "Namelist control variables" section below)

        The output fire emissions datasets contain species fire emissions.
        The species emissions are in the variable "fire" and have units of
        molecules/cm^2/s. Fire emission output datasets may contain either
	daily or monthly values( see "output_timing" in the "Namelist control
	variables" section below).

	The fire_emis utility allows for a versatile mapping from each global
        species to species in the "base" fire emission files including multiple
        "base" fire emission species per single global species with an individual 
        weight factor per "base" fire emission species

	fire_emis reads a namelist input file that specifies all aspects
	of the mapping from the "base" fire emission file to a global simulation
        and checks key namelist control variables for validity.  Below is a
        complete listing of all namelist control variables.

	Building fire_emis
        ======== =========

	In the fire_emis source code directory issue the command :

	make_fire_emis

	That's it.  The make_fire_emis script is presently setup to compile
	on either Linux or AIX systems using the Portland Group Fortan90
	compile, pgf90, on Linux system or the xlf90 compiler on IBM
	AIX systems.  If you need to use another compiler such as the Intel
	Fortran90 compiler, ifort, you can set the environment variable

	FC

	before invoking make_fire_emis.  As an example you would issue
	the command :

	export FC=ifort 

	in the sh, bash, or ksh Linux shells or

	setenv FC ifort

	in the csh or tcsh shells.

	The fire_emis utility requires the netcdf library and make_fire_emis
	will attempt to locate the libnetcdf.a library.  However, this is
	not a foolproof process and thus you may need to set the environment variable
	
	NETCDF_DIR

	to the directory containing the file lib/libnetcdf.a.  As an example
        in the ksh shell, if you issued the command :

	export NETCDF_DIR=/usr/local/netcdf-3.6.2

	then make_fire_emis would look for the file libnetcdf.a in the
	directory /usr/local/netcdf-3.6.2/lib (make_fire_emis automatically
	appends the /lib string to the NETCDF_DIR string.

        If you require assistance with compiler and/or netcdf issues send email to :

	Namelist control variables
        ======== ======= =========

	Variable name             Variable type                                   default value
	-------- ----             -------- ----                                   ------- -----

        fire_directory            character(len=132),scalar                       (None)
        fire_filename             character(len=132),array(5)                     (None)
        glb2fire_map              character(len=164),array(500)                   (None)
        start_date                character(len=10),scalar                        (None)
        end_date                  character(len=10),scalar                        (None)
        resol                     character(len=16),scalar                        (None)

        output_timing             character(len=7),scalar                          'daily'
        diag_level                integer,scalar                                   100

	The first six variables must be set in the input namelist file or fire_emis will error halt.

	None of the remaining namelist variables need be set.

        Namelist variable notes
	======== ======== =====

	fire_directory
	--------------

	  Specifies the directory where fire_emis expects to find the "base"
	  fire emission dataset and the vegetation cover datasets.  Note that
          fire_directory must end with a "/" as in :

	  /myhome/FIRE_data/

	fire_filename
	-------------

	  Specifies a list of up to five filenames of the "base" fire emission datasets.

          The "base" fire emissions were calculated by Christine Wiedinmyer (christin@ucar.edu)
          with the Fire INventory from NCAR (FINN). These can be downloaded from:
		http://bai.acd.ucar.edu/Data/fire/ 

          The "base" fire emission datasets are available for 3 chemical mechanisms, 
          MOZART-4 ("MOZ4"), SAPR99 and GEOS-chem.

	  The ACD WRF repository contains files for the years 2005 through
	  2010 for each group.  Each file is in compressed format and contains fire
	  emission data for an entire year.  When the files are uncompressed they produce
          a file with the filename of the following form :

	  FINNv1_<year>_<group>_<creation_date>

	  where :

	  year           =  year of the emissions in form yyyy
	  group          =  group name
	  creation_date  =  date on which the file was created

          Thus a "MOZART" emission file for year 2009 that was
	  created on May 1, 2011 will uncompress into the file

	  FINNv1_2009_MOZ4_20110501

          and a counterpart for the SAPRC99 group uncompress to

	  FINNv1_2009_SAPRC99_20110501

          Please NOTE that the compressed files yield differing
          numbers of uncompressed files depending on the year
	  of the emissions.  Furthermore, the <date> portion of
	  the uncompressed names varies depending on the year
	  of the emissions and the number of uncompressed files.
	  Thus you should look carefully at the uncompressed filenames
	  before setting this namelist variable.

          You may wish to specify more than one fire_filename input.
	  Consider the case where you want fire emissions for a MOZ4
	  case for the last week of December, 2006 and the first week
	  of January, 2007.  You specify this with the following
	  fire_filename settings :

	  fire_filename(1) = 'FINNv1_2006_MOZ4_20110501'
	  fire_filename(2) = 'FINNv1_2007_MOZ4_20110501'
          start_date       = '2006-12-25'
          end_date         = '2007-01-07'

          If you specify multiple fire filenames the times in the input
          files must be consecutive with no gaps.

	glb2fire_map
	------------

	  Specifies the mapping between global model variables and fire emission variables.
	  glb2fire_map is a character array of size 500.  If you enter more than 500
	  variables there is no error halt but only the first 500 will be mapped.

          Each entry in the is of the form :

	  <global_variable> -> multiplier * <fire_emission_variable> + multiplier * <fire_emission_variable>

	  Where

	  <global_variable> is the name of the global variable and is used to annotate the
          file name of the output emission files.

	  multiplier is any legal, positive fortran real or integer number.  multiplier defaults
          to 1. and may vary from fire emission variable to fire emission variable.

	  <fire_emission_variable> is the exact name of a variable in the fire emission dataset.
          You may have any number of fire emission variables per each  global variable.

	  Individual entries in the glb2fire_map namelist variable are separated by commas and
          each entry must fit on a single line in the input file.  Each src_map entry is limited
          to 164 characters.

	  The following are two examples of src_map specification; as such they are each only
	  for one global variable.

	  glb2fire_map = 'co -> CO'

	  maps the fire emission variable CO to the global variable co.
  
          glb2fire_map = 'co -> CO', 'hc3 -> alk2 +  1.11 * alk3 + 0.4 * meoh'

	  maps as in the prior example and adds a weighted combination of fire emission variables
          alk2, alk2 and meoh to the global variable hc3.
          
	start_date
	----------

	  Specifies the start date for the output fire emissions.
	  <date> is a date of format yyyy-mm-dd wherein

	  yyyy = four digit year
          mm   = two  digit month of year
          dd   = two  digit day of month

	  thus a start_date of 2008-06-11 is for June 11, 2008.

	end_date
	--------

	  Specifies the end date for the output fire emissions.
	  <date> is a date of format yyyy-mm-dd wherein

	  yyyy = four digit year
          mm   = two  digit month of year
          dd   = two  digit day of month

	  thus a start_date of 2008-06-17 is for June 17, 2008.

	resol
	-----

	  Specifies the horizontal resolution of the output emission datasets.

	  The valid settings for resol are :

	  '0.5x0.5'            half degree resolution (720x360)
	  '1x1'                one degree resolution  (360x180)
	  'T42LR'              Lin-Rood t42 grid      (128x64)
	  'T63LR'              Lin-Rood t63 grid      (192x96)
	  'T85LR'              Lin-Rood t85 grid      (256x128)
	  'T106LR'             Lin-Rood t106 grid     (320x160)
	  'T170LR'             Lin-Rood t170 grid     (512x256)
	  '1.9x2.5'            Lin-Rood grid          (144x96)

	output_timing
	-------------

	  Specifies the temporal frequency of emissions output.

          The output_timing variable may either be :

	  'daily' or 'monthly'

	  and defaults to 'daily'.

	diag_level
	----------

	  Specifies the level of diagnostics output when running fire_emis.  The default
	  value of 100 results in the minimum diagnostic output.  The diag level is set
	  in multiples of 100.  Setting diag_level to 400 produces maximal diagnostics
	  and is appropriate when a prior fire_emis invocation has failed.

	Following is an example of a namelist input file (e.g. fire_emis.inp) for MOZART chemistry:
	
&control
        fire_directory = '/home/user/fire/',
	fire_filename(1)  = 'FINNv1_2008_MOZ4_20110501',
	start_date     = '2008-06-26',
	end_date       = '2008-07-15',
        resol          = '1x1',
        output_timing  = 'monthly',

        glb2fire_map = 'co -> CO', 'no -> NO', 'so2 -> SO2', 'bigalk -> BIGALK',
            'bigene -> BIGENE', 'c2h4 -> C2H4', 'c2h5oh -> C2H5OH',
            'c2h6 -> C2H6', 'c3h8 -> C3H8','c3h6 -> C3H6','ch2o -> CH2O', 'ch3cho -> CH3CHO',
            'ch3coch3 -> CH3COCH3','ch3oh -> CH3OH','mek -> MEK','toluene -> TOLUENE',
            'nh3 -> NH3','no2 -> NO2','open -> BIGALD','c10h16 -> C10H16',
            'ch3cooh -> CH3COOH','cres -> CRESOL','glyald -> GLYALD','mgly -> CH3COCHO',
            'gly -> CH3COCHO','acetol -> HYAC','isop -> ISOP','macr -> MACR', 'mvk -> MVK',
            'oc -> OC', 'bc -> BC'
/


	Running fire_emis
        ======= =========

	To run fire_emis issue the command:

	fire_emis < fire_emis.inp > fire_emis.out

        (Redirected input is required. Redirected output to fire_emis.out is optional.
         The fire_emis.inp and fire_emis.out filenames are for illustration only; you
         may use any valid filename in place of fire_emis.inp, fire_emis.out)

        Once you have downloaded and compiled the fire_emis utility you can
	perform a short test.  Assuming that you have placed the fire emission
	files in the top level directory fire_emis you should :

	(1)   Go to the ACD FINNv1 website and down load the file

	      GLOB_MAY_SEPT2008_05062011_MOZ4.tgz

	      to the fire_emis/data_files directory.

	(2)   Unzip and untar the GLOB*tgz file via :

              tar -zxf GLOB_MAY_SEPT2008_05062011_MOZ4.txt

              This should yield three files

	      GLOB_JAN_APR2008_05062011_MOZ4.txt
	      GLOB_MAY_SEPT2008_05062011_MOZ4.txt
	      GLOB_OCT_DEC2008_05062011_MOZ4.txt

	(3)   get into the fire_emis/test directory

	(4)   issue the command :

              ../src/fire_emis < fire_emis.glb.inp

	fire_emis should take about 3 to 5 minutes to run.  The output should
	be 7 files of the form :

	emissions_<species>_1x1.nc   where <species> = {co,no,so2,bigalk,bigene,c2h4,oc}

        Each file contains the monthly average fire emissions for June, 2008.
