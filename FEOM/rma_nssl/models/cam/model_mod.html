<A NAME="OVERVIEW"></A>
<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>
The DART system supports data assimilation into the Community Atmosphere Model, CAM,
which is the atmospheric component of the Community Earth System Model 
(<a href="http://www2.cesm.ucar.edu/models">CESM</a>).
This DART interface is being used by graduate students,
post-graduates, and scientists at universities and research labs
to conduct data assimilation reseearch. 
Others are using the products of data assimilation (analyses), 
which were produced here at NCAR using CESM+DART,
to conduct related research.
The variety of research can be sampled on the DART 
<a href="http://www.image.ucar.edu/DAReS/Publications/index.php">Publications</a> page.
</P>

<P>
"CAM" refers to a family of related atmospheric components, 
which can be built with 2 independent main characteristics. CESM labels these as:
<pre>
   'resolution' = horizontal (not vertical) grid AND dynamical core (fluid dynamics equations on that grid)
      3 supported dycores; eulerian, FV, and SE 
      SE refined grids will have some support, but by their nature invite the use 
        of user defined grid and map files.
   'compset' = vertical grid AND parameterizations (aka physics):
      Parameterization is the equations describing a physical process like
         convection, radiation, chemistry, ...
      Vertical grid is determined by the needs of the chosen parameterizations.
         Spacing and height of the top (ptop) vary.
      The combinations of parameterizations and vertical grids are named:
         CAM3.5, CAM5, CAM#, ...
         WACCM, WACCM#, WACCM-X, 
         CAM-Chem,
         ...
</pre>
There are minor characteristics choices within each of these, 
but only chemistry choices in WACCM and CAM-Chem have an impact on DART.
As of April, 2015, all of these variants are handled by the same model_mod.f90,
namelist, and build scripts, with differences in the assimilation set up 
described <a href="#SetupVariations">here</a>.
</P>

This DART+CAM interface has the following features.
<UL>
<LI>Assimilate within the CESM software framework by using the multi-instance
capability of CESM1.1.1 (and later).  
This enables assimilation of suitable observations into multiple CESM components.
The ability to assimilate in the previous mode, where DART called 'stand-alone' CAMs
when needed, is not being actively supported for these CESM versions.
<LI>Use either the eulerian, finite-volume (FV), or spectral-element (SE) dynamical core.</LI>
<LI>Use any resolution of CAM, including refined mesh grids in CAM-SE.
As of April, 2015 this is limited by the ability of the memory of a node of your hardware to contain 
the state vector of a single ensemble member.  Work is under way to relax this restriction.
</LI>
<LI>Assimilate a variety of observations; to date the observations
successfully assimilated include the NCEP reanalysis BUFR obs (T,U,V,Q), 
Global Positioning System radio occultation obs, and MOPITT carbon monoxide 
(when a chemistry model is incorporated into CAM-FV). 
Research has also explored assimilating surface observations, 
cloud liquid water, and aerosols.
SABER and AURA observations have been assimilated into WACCM.</LI>
<LI>Specify, via namelist entries, the CAM (initial file) variables which will be 
directly affected by the observations, that is, the state vector.
This allows users to change the model state without recompiling
(but other restrictions remain).</LI>
<LI>Generate analyses on the CAM grid which have only CAM model error in them, 
rather than another model's.</LI>
<LI>Generate such analyses with as few as 20 ensemble members.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
In addition to the standard DART package there are ensembles of initial
condition files at the large file website
<a href="http://www.image.ucar.edu/pub/DART/CAM/">
http://www.image.ucar.edu/pub/DART/CAM/</a>
that are helpful for interfacing CAM with DART.
In the current (2015) mode, CESM+DART can easily be started from a single
model state, which is perturbed to create an ensemble of the desired size.
A spin-up period is then required to allow the ensemble members to diverge.
</P>

<P>
Sample sets of observations, which can be used with CESM+DART assimilations,
can be found at 
<a href="http://www.image.ucar.edu/pub/DART/Obs_sets/">
http://www.image.ucar.edu/pub/DART/Obs_sets/</a>
of which the NCEP BUFR observations are the most widely used.
</P>

<P>
Experience on a variety of machines has shown that it is a very good idea to
make sure your run-time environment has the following:
</P>
<pre>
limit stacksize unlimited
limit datasize unlimited
</pre>
<P>
This page contains the documentation for 
the DART interface module for the CAM and WACCM models,
using the dynamical cores listed above.
This implementation uses the CAM initial files (not restarts) for 
transferring the model state to/from the filter.  
This may change in future versions, but probably only for CAM-SE.
The reasons for this include:
<OL>
<LI> The contents of the restart files vary depending on both the model release version
and the physics packages selected.
<LI> There is no metadata describing the variables in the restart files.
Some information can be tracked down in the atm.log file, but not all of it.
<LI> The restart files (for non-chemistry model versions) are much larger than the
initial files (and we need to deal with an ensemble of them).
<LI> The temperature on the restart files is virtual equivalent potential temperature,
which requires (at least) surface pressure, specific humidity, and sensible temperature
to calculate.
<LI> CAM does not call the initialization routines when restart files are used,
so fields which are not modified by DART may be inconsistent with fields which are.
<LI> If DART modifies the contents of the .r. restart file, it might also need to 
modify the contents of the .rs. restart file, which has similar characteristics 
(1-3 above) to the .r. file.
</OL>
</P>
<P>
Due to the complexity of the CESM software environment, the versions of CESM
which can be used for assimilation are more restricted than previously.  
Each supported CESM version has similar, but unique,
sets of set-up scripts and CESM SourceMods.
Those generally do not affect the cam/model_mod.f90 interface.
Current (April, 2015) set-up scripts are:
<UL>
<LI> CESM1_2_1_setup_pmo: sets up a perfect_model_mod experiment, 
which creates synthetic observations from a free model run,
based on the user's somewhat restricted choice of model, dates, etc.  
The restrictions are made in order to
streamline the script, which will shorten the learning curve for new users.
<LI> CESM1_2_1_setup_pmo_advanced: same as CESM1_2_1_setup_pmo, 
but can handle more advanced set-ups: recent dates (non-default forcing files),
refined-grid CAM-SE, etc.
<LI> CESM1_2_1_setup_hybrid: streamlined script (see CESM1_2_1_setup_pmo)
which sets up an ensemble assimilation using CESM's multi-instance capability.
<LI> CESM1_2_1_setup_advanced: like CESM1_2_1_setup_pmo_advanced, 
but for setting up an assimilation.
</UL>
</P>

<P>
The DART state vector should include all prognostic variables in the CAM initial
files which cannot be calculated directly from other prognostic variables.
In practice the state vector sometimes contains derived quantities to enable DART
to compute forward operators (expected observation values) efficiently.
The derived quantities are often overwritten when the model runs the
next timestep, so the work DART does to update them is wasted work.
</P>

<P>
Expected observation values on pressure, scale height, height or model levels 
can be requested from model_interpolate.  
Surface observations can not yet be interpolated, due to the difference between 
the model surface and the earth's surface where the observations are made.  
Model_interpolate can be queried for any (non-surface) variable in the state vector 
(which are variables native to CAM) plus pressure on height levels.  
The default state vector is PS, T, U, V, Q, CLDLIQ, CLDICE and any tracers or
chemicals needed for a given study.  
Variables which are not in the initial file 
<A HREF="doc/cam_guidelines.html">can be added</A>, 
but minor modifications to model_mod.f90 and CAM may be necessary.  
</P>

<P>
The 16 public interfaces in model_mod
are standardized for all DART compliant models. These interfaces allow
DART to get the model state and metadata describing 
this state, find state variables that are close to a given location, 
and do spatial interpolation for a variety of variables required by
observational operators.

<P>
The names of the fields to put into the state vector come from the CAM initial
file field names.
The specification of lists of names and numbers for the various dimensions 
enables the very flexible definition of the state vector.  It can be
done via the namelist, instead of recompiling DART for each different set.
In the CESM+DART framework, filter initial condition files are
created based on the state vector defined in the namelist.
</P>

<P>
The dimension of these lists is currently hardwired to size 100. 
If more fields need to be assimilated (e.g. many chemical species),
look for the integer parameter MAX_STATE_NAMES in the source code
and change it to a large enough value and recompile DART.

<A NAME="SetupVariations"></A>
<H2> Setup Variations </H2>
<P>
The variants of CAM require slight changes to the setup scripts 
(in $DART/models/cam/shell_scripts) and in the namelists 
(in $DART/models/cam/work/input.nml).  
From the DART side, assimilations can be started from a pre-existing ensemble,
or an ensemble can be created from a single initial file before the first assimilation.
In addition, there are setup differences between 'perfect model' runs,
which are used to generate synthetic observations, and assimilation runs.
Those differences are extensive enough that they've been coded into separate 
<A HREF="#SetupScripts">setup scripts</A>:
</P>

<P>
Since the CESM compset and resolution, and the initial ensemble source
are essentially independent of each other, changes for each of those
may need to be combined to perform the desired setup.
</P>

<A NAME="#PerturbedEnsemble"></A>:
<P>
The default values in work/input.nml and shell_scripts/CESM1_2_1_setup_{pmo,hybrid}
are set up for a CAM-FV, single assimilation cycle
using the default values as found in model_mod.f90 and 
starting from a single model state, which must be perturbed into an ensemble.
The following are suggestions for setting it up for other assimilations.
Namelist variables listed here might be in any namelist within input.nml.
</P>


<H3> CAM-FV </H3>
<P>
<a name="CAM-FV"></a>
If built with the FV dy-core, the number of model top levels with extra diffusion 
in CAM is controlled by div24del2flag.  The recommended minium values of 
highest_state_pressure_Pa come from that variable, and cutoff*vert_normalization_X:
<pre> 
   2    ("div2") -&gt; 2 levels  -&gt; highest_state_pressure_Pa =  9400. Pa
   4,24 ("del2") -&gt; 3 levels  -&gt; highest_state_pressure_Pa = 10500. Pa
</pre>
<pre>
   vert_coord          = 'pressure'
   state_num_1d        = 0,
   state_num_2d        = 1,
   state_num_3d        = 6,
   state_names_1d      = ''
   state_names_2d      = 'PS'
   state_names_3d      = 'T', 'US', 'VS', 'Q', 'CLDLIQ', 'CLDICE'
   which_vert_1d       = 0,
   which_vert_2d       = -1,
   which_vert_3d       = 6*1,
   highest_state_pressure_Pa = 9400. or 10500. 
</pre>
</P>


<H3> CAM-SE </H3>
<P>
<a name="CAM-SE"></a>
There's an existing ensemble, so see <a href="#Continuing">Continuing</a> 
to start from it instead of a single state.
To set up a "1-degree" CAM-SE assimilation CESM1_2_1_setup_hybrid:
<pre>
   setenv resolution  ne30_g16  
   setenv refcase     SE30_Og16
   setenv refyear     2005
   setenv refmon      08
   setenv refday      01
</pre>
input.nml:
<pre>
   approximate_distance = .FALSE.
   vert_coord          = 'pressure'
   state_num_1d        = 1,
   state_num_2d        = 6,
   state_num_3d        = 0,
   state_names_1d      = 'PS'
   state_names_2d      = 'T','U','V','Q','CLDLIQ','CLDICE'
   state_names_3d      = ''
   which_vert_1d       = -1,
   which_vert_2d       = 6*1,
   which_vert_3d       = 0,
   highest_obs_pressure_Pa   = 1000.,
   highest_state_pressure_Pa = 10500.,
</pre>
</P>

<H3> Variable resolution CAM-SE </H3>
<P>
<a name="VarresCAM-SE"></a>
To set up a variable resolution CAM-SE assimilation (as of April 2015) 
there are many changes to both the CESM code tree and the DART setup scripts.
This is for very advanced users, so please contact dart @ ucar dot edu or 
raeder @ ucar dot edu for scripts and guidance.
</P>

<H3> WACCM </H3>
<P>
<a name="WACCM"></a>
WACCM[#][-X] has a much higher top than the CAM versions,
which requires the use of scale height as the vertical coordinate,
instead of pressure, during assimilation.
One impact of the high top is that the number of top model levels 
with extra diffusion in the FV version is different than in the 
low-topped CAM-FV, so the div24del2flag options lead to the following 
minimum values for highest_state_pressure_Pa:
<pre> 
   2    ("div2") -&gt; 3 levels  -&gt; highest_state_pressure_Pa = 0.01 Pa
   4,24 ("del2") -&gt; 4 levels  -&gt; highest_state_pressure_Pa = 0.02 Pa
</pre>
The best choices of vert_normalization_scale_height, cutoff, and 
highest_state_pressure_Pa are still being investigated (April, 2015), 
and may depend on the observation distribution being assimilated.
</P>

<P>
WACCM is also typically run with coarser horizontal resolution.
There's an existing 2-degree ensemble, so see <a href="#Continuing">Continuing</a> 
to start from it, instead of a single state.
If you use this, ignore any existing inflation restart file

In any case, make the following changes (or similar) to convert from a CAM setup
to a WACCM setup.
CESM1_2_1_setup_hybrid:
<pre>
   setenv compset     F_2000_WACCM
   setenv resolution  f19_f19  
   setenv refcase     FV1.9x2.5_WACCM4
   setenv refyear     2008
   setenv refmon      12
   setenv refday      20
</pre>
input.nml:
<pre>
   vert_normalization_scale_height = 2.5
   vert_coord                = 'log_invP'
   highest_obs_pressure_Pa   = .001,
   highest_state_pressure_Pa = .01,
</pre>
If built with the SE dy-core (warning; experimental), then 4 levels will have
extra diffusion, and also see <a href='CAM-SE'>here</a>.
</P>
<P>
If there are problems with instability in the WACCM foreasts,
try changing some of the following parameters in either the 
user_nl_cam section of the setup script or input.nml.
<UL>
<LI> The default div24del2flag in WACCM is 4.  Change it in the setup script to
<pre>
   echo " div24del2flag         = 2 "                       &gt;&gt; ${fname}
</pre>
which will use the cd_core.F90 in SourceMods, which has doubled diffusion
in the top layers compared to CAM.

<LI> Use a smaller dtime (1800 s is the default for 2-degree) in the setup script.
This can also be changed in the ensemble of user_nl_cam_#### in the $CASEROOT directory.
<pre>
   echo " dtime         = 600 "                             &gt;&gt; ${fname}
</pre>

<LI> Increase highest_state_pressure_Pa in input.nml:
<pre>
   div24del2flag = 2    ("div2") -&gt; highest_state_pressure_Pa = 0.1 Pa
   div24del2flag = 4,24 ("del2") -&gt; highest_state_pressure_Pa = 0.2 Pa
</pre>

<LI> Use a larger nsplit and/or nspltvrm in the setup script: 
<pre>
   echo " nsplit         = 16 "                             &gt;&gt; ${fname}
   echo " nspltvrm       =  4 "                             &gt;&gt; ${fname}
</pre>

<LI> Reduce inf_damping from the default 0.9 in input.nml:
<pre>
   inf_damping           = 0.5,                   0,
</pre>
</UL>


<a name="Continuing"></a>
<H3> Continuing after the first cycle </H3>
<P>
After the first forecast+assimilation cycle, using an ensemble created from a single file,
it is necessary to change to the 'continuing' mode, 
where CAM will not perform all of its startup procedures
and DART will use the most recent ensemble.
This example applies to an assimiation using prior inflation (inf_... = .true.).
If posterior inflation were needed, then the 2nd column of infl_... would be set to "true".
<pre>
input.nml:
   start_from_restart       = .true.,
   restart_in_file_name     = "filter_ics",
   single_restart_file_in  = .false.,

   inf_initial_from_restart    = .true.,                 .false.,
   inf_sd_initial_from_restart = .true.,                 .false.,
</pre>
</P>

<H3> Combining multiple cycles into one job </H3>
<P>
<a name="Cycles"></a>
CESM1_2_1_setup_{hybrid,pmo} are set up in the default cycling mode,
where each submitted job performs one model advance and one assimilation, 
then resubmits the next cycle as a new job.
For long series of cycles, this can result in a lot of time waiting in
the queue for short jobs to run.  
This can be prevented by using the 'cycles' scripts generated by
CESM1_2_1_setup_advanced (instead of ..._hybrid).
This mode is described in the models/cam/doc/README.

Used for run time initialization of the model. This is the first call made
to the model by any DART compliant assimilation routine. It reads the
model_mod namelist parameters, sets the calendar type (the GREGORIAN
calendar is used with the CAM model), and determines the dart vector
length, among other things.  This subroutine requires that caminput.nc,
and SEMapping.nc or SEMapping_cs_grid.nc for CAM-SE,
(or the names in namelist variable model_config_file) be present in the working
directory to retrieve model information (grid dimensions and spacing
including the vertical hybrid coordinate coefficients, time step, and
Gaussian weights, etc).

Returns the nominal useful forecast length for CAM,

<em class=code>get_model_time_step</em> is set by the

<em class=code>&amp;model_nml:Time_step_seconds,Time_step_days</em>

<br />
<em class=code>get_model_time_step</em> also indirectly defines the assimilation window.
Every observation within +/- half the <em class=code>get_model_time_step</em> 
of the current model time will be assimilated.
The current CESM+DART setup scripts also implicitly use this to determine which
set of observations to use. If the observation sequence file has observations
beyond the end of the current assimilation window, DART will try to advance
CAM. This is not supported under the current configuration. Similarly, if the
observation sequence file has observations before the assimilation window,
DART will fail because it cannot move the model backwards in time.
Consequently, the observation sequence files have to be preprocessed to
contain just the observations to be assimilated without advancing the model.

<div class=indent1>
<P>
Given a model state, returns the value of the variable encoded in 
<em class=code>obs_kind</em>
interpolated to a given location by a method of the model's choosing.  
Currently DART 
<A HREF="../../obs_kind/obs_kind_mod.html"><em class=code>KIND</em></A>s:
KIND_U_WIND_COMPONENT, KIND_V_WIND_COMPONENT, KIND_SURFACE_PRESSURE,
KIND_TEMPERATURE, KIND_SPECIFIC_HUMIDITY, KIND_PRESSURE are supported, but
others can be added.  KIND_PRESSURE does not have a corresponding field on
CAM initial files, but is routinely calculated in CAM using its own
subroutines.  Interpolation of this field has been incorporated in order to
facilitate assimilations of observations which require it, such as GPS
radio occultation.  
CAM-SE requires a completely different interpolation algorithm from 
the logically rectangular grids of the eulerian and FV dycores.
So model_interpolate is now simply calls either 
<em class=routine>interp_lonlat</em> or 
<em class=routine>interp_cubed_sphere</em>.
</P>

<P>
If the interpolation is valid, istatus = 0.  
In the case where the observational operator is not defined at the given location
(e.g. the observation is below the lowest model level or above the top level), 
interp_val is returned as <em class=code>MISSING_R8</em> and 
<em class=code>istatus &gt; 0</em>.  
CAM is highly damped in the upper levels of the model, which may require the exclusion
of otherwise valid observations above a certain level, which can be
specified in the model_mod namelist variable <em class=code>highest_obs_pressure_Pa</em> .
Such cases return <em class=code>istatus = 2</em>, and also do the interpolation 
and return the
value, which is NOT used by filter.  Eventually such quality control may be
moved to another module, but for now is performed in subroutine
get_val_pressure.  DART reserves the use of <em class=code>istatus &lt; 0</em>.

<P>
Uses a pre-derived mapping, from the cubed-sphere cell "closest" to a location (observation)
onto the unit square (l,m), to map the "location" onto that square.
This is a bilinear interpolation,
<pre>
  x = a0 + a1*l*m + a2*m + a3*l
  y = b0 + b1*l*m + b2*m + b3*l
</pre>
so does not take into account the curvature of the quadrilateral.
That has been handled by the intermediate mapping from (lon,lat) to (x,y).
If the location is in the cell, the routine passes back the interpolation weights (l,m).
Otherwise, it signals the calling routine to send it another candidate cell.
Based on http://www.particleincell.com/2012/quad-interpolation/.

First calls the

and then updates the distances to account for the extra diffusion in CAM's highest levels.

<P>
CAM uses a hybrid vertical coordinate, which requires the surface pressure
beneath a point in order to determine the point's vertical location.
The ensemble members may each have a different surface pressure,
which could cause an observation to have different distances
to the surrounding grid points.
This can cause the observation to be excluded 
(distance &gt; 2*<em class=code>cutoff</em>)
in some members, but not others, which is an ambiguity we'd like to avoid.
The ensemble mean state is used to a provide a consistent 
vertical location for the whole ensemble.
All observations on height and level are handled automatically, using the 
ensemble mean for calculations. 
<br><br>
Due to the extra diffusion at high levels in CAM 
(see <a href="#model_interpolate">model_interpolate</a>)
there is also code 
which reduces the influence of all observations on model points above some altitude.
Currently namelist variable 
<em class="code">highest_state_pressure_Pa</em> controls this.
The default value in model_mod (for CAM), and the values for WACCM given in 
<A HREF="./doc/model_top_issues.pdf">model_top_issues.pdf</A>, 
gradually reduce the influence of observations from full strength at 
<em class="code">highest_state_pressure_Pa</em>
to 0 at the model levels where extra diffusion is applied (2 or 3 for CAM,
3 or 4 for WACCM).

This implementation allows each field in the state vector to be randomly
perturbed with a separate standard deviation.  The fields to be perturbed,

state_names_pert should be in the same order as those in state_names_#d (#
= 0,1,2,3 in that order).  As in the default, the perturbations sd*N[0,1]
are added onto the basic state field, so sd should not be a percentage of
the basic state field, but an actual physical size.

<P>
Ave Arellano did the first work with CAM-Chem, assimilating MOPPITT CO observations
into CAM-Chem.  Jerome Barre and Benjamin Gaubert took up the development
work from Ave, and prompted several additions to DART, as well as cam/model_mod.
</P>

<P>
Nick Pedatella developed the first vert_coord = 'log_invP' capability
to enable assimilation using WACCM and scale height vertical locations.

<LI> coord_ind_cs needs to dimension local variables, but current size is

     <pre>
           integer  :: close_ind(ncol)
           real(r8) :: dist(ncol)
     </pre>

<LI>Describe:
   <pre>
   - The coordinate orders and translations; CAM initial file, model_mod, and DART _Diag.nc.
     Motivations
   - There need to be 2 sets of arrays for dimensions and dimids;
       one describing the caminput file (f_...)
       and one for the state (s_...) (storage in this module).
            Call them f_dim_Nd , f_dimid_Nd
                      s_dim_Nd , s_dimid_Nd
   </pre></LI>

<LI> Change (private only) subroutine argument lists; structures first, regardless of in/out
     then output, and input variables.</LI>
<LI> Change declarations to have dummy argument integers used as dimensions first</LI>
<LI> Implement a grid_2d_type?  Convert phis to a grid_2d_type?
     ps, and staggered ps fields could also be this type.</LI>
<LI> Deallocate grid_1d_arrays using end_1d_grid_instance in end_model.
     end_model is called by subroutines pert_model_state, nc_write_model_vars; 
     any problem?.</LI>


ISSUE; In P[oste]rior_Diag.nc ensemble members are written out *between* the field mean/spread
       pair and the inflation mean/sd pair.  Would it make more sense to put members after
       both pairs?  Easy to do?

ISSUE?; model_interpolate assumes that obs with a vertical location have 2 horizontal locations
        too.  The state vector may have fields for which this isn't true, but no obs we've seen
        so far violate this assumption.  It would have to be a synthetic/perfect_model obs,
        like some sort of average or parameter value.

ISSUE; In convert_vert, if a 2D field has dimensions (lev, lat) then how is p_surf defined?
       Code would be needed to set the missing dimension to 1, or make
       different calls to coord_ind, etc.

ISSUE; The KIND_ list from obs_def_mod must be updated when new fields are added to state vector.
       This could be done by the preprocessor when it inserts the code bits corresponding to the
       lists of observation types, but it currently (10/06) does not.  Document accordingly.

ISSUE: The CCM code (and Hui's packaging) for geopotentials and heights  use different
       values of the physical constants than DART's.  In one case Shea changed g from
       9.81 to 9.80616, to get agreement with CCM(?...), so it may be important.
       Also, matching with Hui's tests may require using his values;  change to DART
       after verifying?

ISSUE: It's possible to figure out the model_version from the NetCDF file
       itself, rather than have that be user-provided (sometimes incorrect and hard
       to debug) meta-data.  model_version is also misnamed; it's really the
       caminput.nc model version.  The actual model might be a different version(?)
       The problem with removing it from the namelist is that the scripts need it
       too, so some rewriting there would be needed.

"CS" marks changes to accommodate Spectral Element CAM's cubed sphere grid;
     See model_mod.f90s from 2014/1-3.
ISSUE: max_neighbors is set to 6, but could be set to 4 for non-refined grids.
       Is there a good mechanism for this?  Is it worth the file space savings?
ISSUE: x_planar and y_planar could be reduced in rank, if no longer needed for
       testing and debugging.

"Pobs" marks changes for providing expected obs of P
       break from past philosophy; P is not a native CAM variable (but is already calced here)

NOVERT marks modifications for fields with no vertical location,
i.e. GWD parameters.
