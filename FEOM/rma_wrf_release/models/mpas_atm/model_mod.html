<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>This document describes the DART interface module for 
the MPAS-Atmosphere (or briefly, MPAS-ATM) global model, 
which uses an unstructured Voronoi grid mesh, formally Spherical Centriodal Voronoi 
Tesselations (SCVTs). This allows for both quasi-uniform discretization of the sphere and 
local refinement. The MPAS/DART interface was built on the SCVT-dual mesh and does not 
regrid to regular lat/lon grids. In the C-grid discretization, the normal component of
velocity on cell edges is prognosed; zonal and meridional wind components are diagnosed
on the cell centers.  We provide several options to choose from in the assimilation
of wind observations as shown below.
</P>
<P>
The grid terminology used in MPAS is as shown in the figure below:
</P>
<img src="../../doc/images/MPAS_grid_structure.png" alt="MPAS_grid_structure" height=600 />
<P>
The wind options during a DART assimilation
are controlled by combinations of 4 different namelist values.
The values determine which fields the forward operator uses to compute expected 
observation values; how the horizontal interpolation is computed in that
forward operator; and how the assimilation increments
are applied to update the wind quantities in the state vector.
Preliminary results based on real data assimilation experiments indicate that 
performance is better when the zonal and meridional winds are used as
input to the forward operator that uses Barycentric interpolation, and when the 
prognostic <i>u</i> wind is updated by the incremental method described in
the figure below.
However there remain
scientific questions about how best to handle the wind fields under different
situations.  Thus we have kept all implemented options available for use in
experimental comparisons.  See the figure below for a flow-chart representation
of how the 4 namelist items interact:
</P>

<P>
Cycling of MPAS/DART is run in a <u>restart</u> mode.
As for all DART experiments, the overall design for an experiment is this:
the DART program <em class="program">filter</em> will read the initial
condition file, the observation sequence file, and the DART namelist
to decide whether or not to advance the MPAS-ATM model. All of the
control of the execution of the MPAS model is done by DART directly.
If the model needs to be advanced, <em class="program">filter</em> makes
a call to the shell to execute the script
<em class="program">advance_model.csh</em>,
which is ENTIRELY responsible
for getting all the input files, data files, namelists, etc. into
a temporary directory, running the model, and copying the results
back to the parent directory (which we call CENTRALDIR).
The whole process hinges on setting the MPAS-ATM model namelist values
such that it is doing a restart for every model advance.
Unlike MPAS-ATM free forecast runs, the forecast step in MPAS/DART requires to 
set up one more namelist parameter called "config_do_DAcycling = .true." in &amp;restart section 
of namelist.input to recouple the state vectors (updated by filter) with the mass field for the restart mode.
For more information, check the <a href="shell_scripts/advance_model.csh">advance_model.csh</a> script. </P>
<P>

Since DART is an ensemble algorithm, there are multiple analysis files for a single analysis time: 
one for each ensemble member. Because MPAS/DART is run in a restart mode, each member should keep its own
MPAS restart file from the previous cycle (rather than having a single template file in CENTRALDIR).
Creating the initial ensemble of states is an area of active research.

    <TD>The name of the MPAS file to be read 
        by the DART programs for the grid information.  Generally
        this is the same as the <em class=code>model_analysis_filename</em>.
        However, the grid information is large and if the grid is static
        that information could be omitted from the analysis files to

    <TD>Observations higher than this pressure are ignored. Set to -1.0
        to ignore this test.  For models with a prescribed top boundary
        layer, trying to assimilate very high observations results in 
        problems because the model damps out any changes the assimilation
        tries to make.  With adaptive algorithms this results in larger
        and larger coefficients as the assimilation tries to effect state
        vector change.

<TR><TD>output_state_vector</TD>
    <TD>logical <em class=units>[default:&nbsp;.false.]</em></TD>
    <TD>The switch to determine the form of the state vector in the

        meters, as the numerical vertical location), and the surface elevation as
        defined by the model. Observations further away from the surface than this

<A NAME="mpas_vars_nml"></A>
<P>
The <em class=code>&amp;mpas_vars_nml</em> namelist contains the list 
of MPAS variables that make up the DART state vector.
The order the items are specified controls the order of the data in the
state vector, so it should not be changed without regenerating all
DART initial condition or restart files.
These variables are directly updated by the filter assimilation.
</P>
<P>
Any variables whose values cannot exceed a given
minimum or maximum can be listed in <em class=code>mpas_state_bounds</em>.
When the data is written back into the MPAS NetCDF files values
outside the allowed range will be detected and changed.  
Data inside the DART state vector and data written to 
the DART diagnostic files will not go through this test and
values may exceed the allowed limits.
Note that changing values at the edges of the distribution
means it is no longer completely gaussian.  In practice
this technique has worked effectively, but if the assimilation
is continually trying to move the values outside the permitted
range the results may be of poor quality.  Examine the diagnostics for
these fields carefully when using bounds to restrict their values.

   The variables are simply read from the MPAS analysis file and stored in the DART state
   vector such that all quantities for one variable are stored contiguously. Within each
   variable; they are stored vertically-contiguous for each horizontal location. From a storage 
   standpoint, this would be equivalent to a Fortran variable dimensioned 
   x(nVertical,nHorizontal,nVariables). The fastest-varying dimension is vertical,
   then horizontal, then variable ... naturally, the DART state vector is 1D. 
   Each variable is also stored this way in the MPAS analysis file.

NOTE: While MPAS requires the PIO (Parallel IO) and pNetCDF
(Parallel NetCDF) libraries, DART uses only the plain NetCDF libraries.
If an altered NetCDF library is required by the parallel versions, there may 
be incompatibilities between the run-time requirements of DART and MPAS.
Static linking of one or the other executable, or swapping of modules
between executions may be necessary.

   <h3>Converting between DART files and MPAS analysis files</h3>
   <P>is relatively straightforward. Given the namelist mechanism for
      determining the state variables and the MPAS history netCDF
      files exist, - everything that is needed is readily determined.
      <br />
      <br />
      There are two programs - both require the list of MPAS variables 
      to use in the DART state vector: the
      <em class="code">mpas_vars_nml</em> namelist in the 
      <em class="file">input.nml</em> file. The MPAS file name being 
      read and/or written is - in all instances - specified by the 
      <em class="code">model_nml:model_analysis_filename</em> variable in the 
      <em class="file">input.nml</em> namelist file.
   </P>
   <table width="100%" cellpadding="10">
   <tr><td valign="top"><a href="model_to_dart.html">model_to_dart.f90</a></td>
       <td>converts an MPAS analysis file (nominally named <em class=file>mpas_init.nc</em>) into a 
       DART-compatible file normally called <em class=file>dart_ics</em>&nbsp;.
       We usually wind up linking the actual analysis file to a static name that is used by DART.
       </td>
   </tr>
   <tr><td valign="top"><a href="dart_to_model.html">dart_to_model.f90</a></td>
       <td>inserts the DART output into an existing MPAS analysis netCDF file by
       overwriting the variables in the analysis netCDF file. 
       There are two different types of DART output files, so there is a namelist
       option to specify if the DART file has two time records or just one 
       (if there are two, the first one is the 'advance_to' time, followed 
       by the 'valid_time' of the ensuing state).
       <em class=program>dart_to_model</em> updates the MPAS analysis file 
       specified in <em class=file>input.nml</em><em class=code>model_nml:model_analysis_filename</em>.
       If the DART file contains an 'advance_to' time, separate control information is written 
       to an auxiliary file (named 'mpas_time') that is used by the <em class=file>advance_model.csh</em> script.
       </td>

<!-- In namelist.input for the mpas model, we do have start_time, run_duration, and output_interval as below.

  config_start_time = '2010-10-23_03:00:00'  
  config_run_duration = '00_00:15:00'
  config_output_interval = '00_00:15:00'

Here the run_duration and output_interval do not have 'YYYY-MM', but the rest of them are the same as in start_time.
Do you think that is enough for the advance_model script? -->

<P>
Given a model state, <em class=code>model_interpolate</em> returns the value of 
the desired observation type (which could be a state variable) that would be 
observed at the desired location. The interpolation method is either
completely specified by the model, or uses some standard 2D or 3D scalar
interpolation routines.
Put another way, <em class=code>model_interpolate</em> will apply the forward
operator <strong>H</strong> to the model state to create an observation at the desired 
location.
<br />
<br />
If the interpolation is valid, <em class=code>istatus = 0</em>. 
In the case where the observation operator is not defined at the given 
location (e.g. the observation is below the lowest model level, above the top
level, a type not found in the state vector), interp_val is returned 
as <em>MISSING_R8</em> and istatus = 1.

<!-- Description -->

<P>
Given a DART location (referred to as "base") and a set of locations, and a
definition of 'close' - return a subset of locations that are 'close', as well
as their distances to the DART location and their indices. This routine intentionally
masks a routine of the same name in <em class=program>location_mod</em> because we
need to be able to convert vertical coordinates that are not already
in the same units as specified by
<em class=file>input.nml</em>::<em class=code>&amp;model_nml:vert_localization_coord</em>.
<br />
<br />
Given a single location and a list of other locations, returns the indices
of all the locations close to the single one along with the number of
these and the distances for the close ones.  The list of locations
passed in via the <em class=code>obs</em> argument must be identical to
the list of <em class=code>obs</em> passed into the most recent call
to <em class=code>get_close_obs_init()</em>.  If the list of locations
of interest changes, <em class=code>get_close_obs_destroy()</em> must
be called and then the two initialization routines must be called
before using <em class=code>get_close_obs()</em> again.
<br />
<br />
For vertical distance computations, the general philosophy is to convert all
vertical coordinates to a common coordinate. This coordinate type is defined
in the namelist with the variable "vert_localization_coord".
