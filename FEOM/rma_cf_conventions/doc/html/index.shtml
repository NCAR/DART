   <h2>Getting Started</h2>
   <p>
   The DART software provides a flexible, extensible framework for conducting
   data assimilation research on a wide variety of models and observations.
   In order to facilitate the incorporation of new models, which in the 
   Geoscience community are frequently written in Fortran 90, the DART 
   software is written primarily in Fortran 90. Control scripts are primarily
   in C Shell, and the distribution includes Matlab&reg; diagnostic scripts.
   </p>
   <p>
   The DART system comes with many models -- ranging from 1-dimensional
   Lorenz systems to full global atmospheric and ocean models. 
   DART also has extensive tutorial materials that explain typical DART experiments
   and explores many aspects of ensemble data assimilation.
   <a href="#download">Download the DART source code</a> and see the
   <a href="Lanai_release.html">release notes</a> for
   instructions on how to build an executable, run the "workshop" experiments, 
   and look at the results.  The <em class=file>DART_LAB</em> directory contains
   presentation slides and interactive MATLAB demonstrations which illustrate
   and explain the fundamentals of the ensemble data assimilation algorithms.
   The <em class=file>tutorial</em> directory contains a series of PDF files
   which go into more mathematical detail on various ensemble data assimilation
   topics, and specifics on the DART implementation.
   </p>

   <a name="requirements"></a>
   <h2>DART requirements</h2>
   <p>
   DART is intended to be highly portable but has a strong Unix/Linux preference. 
   DART has been run successfully on Windows machines under the cygwin environment. 
   Those instructions are under development - if you would like to be a friendly 
   beta-tester please send me (Tim Hoar) an email and I'll send you the instructions,
   as long as you promise to provide feedback (good or bad!) so I can improve them. 
   My email is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thoar&nbsp;@&nbsp;ucar&nbsp;.&nbsp;edu  - minus the
   spaces, naturally.
   <br /><br />
   Minimally, you will need a Fortran90 compiler and the netCDF libraries 
   built with the F90 interface. History has shown that it is a very good
   idea to make sure your run-time environment has the following:
   </p>
   <div class=unix>
   limit stacksize unlimited<br />
   limit datasize unlimited
   </div>
   <p>
   If you want to run your own model, all you need is an executable and some scripts
   to interface with DART - we have templates and examples.
   If your model can be called as a subroutine, <em>life is good</em>, and
   the hardest part is usually a routine to parse the model state vector into
   one whopping array - and back. Again - we have templates, examples, and a
   document describing the required interfaces. That document exists in the 
   DART code - <code>DART/models/model_mod.html</code> - as does all the most 
   current documentation.
   Almost every DART program/module has a matching piece of documentation.
   <br /><br />
   Starting with the Jamaica release there is an option to compile with the MPI
   (Message Passing Interface) libraries in order to run the assimilation
   step in parallel on hardware with multiple CPUs.  Note that this is
   optional; MPI is not required to run DART.  If you do want
   to run in parallel then we also require a working MPI library
   and appropriate cluster or SMP hardware.
   See the <a href="mpi_intro.html">MPI&nbsp;intro</a> for more information on
   running with the MPI option.
   <br /><br />
   One of the beauties of ensemble data assimilation is that even if (particularly if)
   your model is single-threaded, you can still run efficiently on parallel machines
   by dealing out each ensemble member (an unique instance of the model) to a separate
   processor. If your model cannot run single-threaded, fear not, DART can do that too.
   </p>

<h2>DART platforms/compilers/batch systems</h2>
<p>
We work to keep the DART code highly portable.
We avoid compiler-specific constructs, 
require no system-specific functions, 
and try as much as possible
to be easy to build on new platforms.
</p>
<p>
DART has been compiled and run on Apple laptops and workstations,
Linux clusters small and large, SGI Altix systems, IBM Power systems,
IBM Intel systems, Cray systems.
</p>
<p>
DART has been compiled with compilers from Intel, PGI, Cray, GNU,
IBM, Pathscale.
</p>
<p>
MPI versions of DART have run under batch systems including
LSF, PBS, Moab/Torque, and Sun Grid Engine.
</p>
<p>
We have run successfully on a Windows machine under the <code>cygwin</code>
environment.  If you are interested in this, please

<h1>DART code distributions</h1>
<p>
The DART code is distributed via a
Subversion (<b>SVN</b>) repository.  Anonymous access is
allowed, and the repository code is read-only for everyone
except the DART development team.  DART is distributed 
as source code, so you must be prepared to build the parts 
of the system you need before you can run it.
</p>
<p>
Using subversion makes it easy to update and
compare your checked-out version of the code 
with the latest repository version of the code. 
If you are not familiar with the <em class=code>svn</em> command
(the client application of subversion),
you should take a stroll through Tim's
<a href="http://www.image.ucar.edu/~thoar/svn_primer.html">svn primer</a>.
Or there are several GUI programs that help you manage, check out,
and merge subversion distributions.
If you cannot use <em class=code>svn</em> 
(e.g. because you are behind a firewall that does not
permit subversion access), please 
<a href="mailto:dart@ucar.edu">email the DART team</a>
and we may be able to send you a tar file as a last resort.
</p>
<p>
The DART development team keeps released versions of the code
which are stable (don't change) except for bug fixes.  Generally
we recommend users check out one of these versions.  The DART
development team makes frequent updates to the trunk version of
the code as new features are developed.  Those users who want
to use recently added features are welcome to check out the trunk,
but they should be prepared to work around possible
non-backwards compatible changes and more lightly tested code
than the released versions.
</p>
<p>
DART continues to evolve.  We request that you register using 
<a href="/DAReS/DART/DART_download">this web page</a>
and afterwards you will be redirected to instructions on
how to download a version of the DART code.
Registration helps us track how many people are using our code,
and allows us to contact current users in case of bugs or major updates.
The DART mailing list is a <strong>very low-traffic</strong> list --
perhaps 4 emails per year -- so PLEASE use a real email address when signing up.
We solemnly swear to protect your email address like it is our own!
Even local NCAR users or users who have registered in the past are
encouraged to reregister when downloading new versions.  Thank you
for your understanding.

      <h2>DART Tutorial Materials and Presentations</h2>
      <p>
      The DART system comes with an extensive set of tutorial materials, working
      models with several different levels of complexity, and data to be assimilated.
      It has been used in several multi-day workshops and can be used as the basis 
      to teach a section on Data Assimilation. <!--add refs to people doing this already-->
      Download the DART software distribution and look in the <code>DART_LAB</code> subdirectory
      for pdf and powerpoint presentations, and MATLAB GUI point-and-click examples and
      hands-on demonstrations.  Also look in the
      <code>tutorial</code> subdirectory for pdf files for each of the 22 tutorial sections.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Browsing the DART_LAB and tutorial directories in the distribution is worth
      the effort. Doing the tutorials is even better!</strong>
      </p>

      <h2>Presentations about DART</h2>
      <p>
      The full list of presentations (as well as some of the
