&lt;p>DART_LAB is a MATLAB®-based tutorial to demonstrate the principles of
ensemble data assimilation. This tutorial begins at a more introductory level
than the materials in the tutorial directory, and includes hands-on exercises
at several points. In a workshop setting, these materials and exercises took
about 1.5 days to complete.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The DART tutorial</title><link>https://dart.ucar.edu/tutorials/dart-tutorial/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Dec 2019 13:32:54 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://dart.ucar.edu/tutorials/dart-tutorial/</guid><description>&lt;p>The DART Tutorial is intended to aid in the understanding of ensemble data assimilation
theory and consists of step-by-step concepts and companion exercises with DART.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>WRF-DART tutorial</title><link>https://dart.ucar.edu/tutorials/wrf-dart/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2020 13:36:06 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://dart.ucar.edu/tutorials/wrf-dart/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="overview">Overview&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The WRF-DART tutorial steps through a WRF-DART experiment.
The experiment covers the continental United States and uses a 50 member ensemble initialized from
NCEP’s Global Forecast System (GFS) initial conditions at 2017/04/27 00:00 UTC.
The data included in the tutorial covers up to 2017/04/30 18:00 UTC.
During this period, there was a strong rain and wind event that affected a large portion of
the United States, causing &lt;strong>record rains&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>localized flooding&lt;/strong>, and numerous &lt;strong>tornadoes&lt;/strong>.
For more information on the physical account of this case, see

diagnostic steps required for a simple global assimilation run using CLM5. It is intended
to be performed after the completion of the more general
&lt;a href="https://docs.dart.ucar.edu/en/stable/theory/readme.html">DART tutorial&lt;/a> which covers the
fundamental concepts of the Ensemble Kalman Filter used within DART. This tutorial
provides fundamental concepts unique to a CLM assimilation, and offers some guidance
to set up a custom CLM assimilation to suite the user&amp;rsquo;s own research needs.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
