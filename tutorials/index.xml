The DART_LAB tutorial begins at a more introductory level than the materials in the tutorial directory, and includes hands-on exercises.</description></item><item><title>The DART tutorial</title><link>https://dart.ucar.edu/tutorials/dart-tutorial/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Dec 2019 13:32:54 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://dart.ucar.edu/tutorials/dart-tutorial/</guid><description>The DART Tutorial is intended to aid in the understanding of ensemble data assimilation theory and consists of step-by-step concepts and companion exercises with DART.</description></item><item><title>WRF-DART tutorial</title><link>https://dart.ucar.edu/tutorials/wrf-dart/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2020 13:36:06 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://dart.ucar.edu/tutorials/wrf-dart/</guid><description>Overview The WRF-DART tutorial steps through a WRF-DART experiment. The experiment covers the continental United States and uses a 50 member ensemble initialized from NCEP’s Global Forecast System (GFS) initial conditions at 2017/04/27 00:00 UTC.</description></item><item><title>CLM5-DART Tutorial</title><link>https://dart.ucar.edu/tutorials/clm-dart/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Mar 2022 11:35:06 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://dart.ucar.edu/tutorials/clm-dart/</guid><description>The CLM5-DART tutorial provides a detailed description of the download, setup, executation and diagnostic steps required for a simple global assimilation run using CLM5. It is intended to be performed after the completion of the more general DART tutorial which covers the fundamental concepts of the Ensemble Kalman Filter used within DART.</description></item></channel></rss>
