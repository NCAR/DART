Welcome to DART, the Data Assimilation Research Testbed.
See the bottom of this file for quick-start instructions.

Extensive on-line documentation is on the project web pages:
 http://www.image.ucar.edu/DAReS/DART

Extensive local documentation is included in the DART subversion
checkout.  Open 'documentation/index.html' in your browser to begin.

A Matlab/PDF introduction is in the documentation/DART_LAB directory.  
There are a set of PDF presentations along with hands-on Matlab exercises.  
This starts with a very basic introduction to data assimilation and covers 
several fundamental algorithms in the system.

A slightly more advanced tutorial in PDF format is in the documentationb/tutorial
subdirectory.  Start with the index file which explains what each subsection covers.

The DART Manhattan release documentation is on the web:
 http://www.image.ucar.edu/DAReS/DART/Manhattan_release.html

and also in the subversion tree here at:
 documentation/html/Manhattan_release.html

General documentation in HTML format is in the documentation/html directory. 
In addition, all parts of the DART system include HTML files in the respective 
model and source directories.  There is an 'index.html' file in the top level
documentation directory which references all the other doc files.

There is a mailing list where we summarize updates to the DART repository
and notify users about recent bug fixes.  It is not generally used for
discussion so it's a low-traffic list.  To add yourself go here and
click on 'Dart-users', and if you use WRF see 'wrfdart-users' also:
 http://mailman.ucar.edu/mailman/listinfo/

The Manhattan release is new and currently supports only a subset of the 
models.  We will port over any requested model so contact us if yours
is not on the list.  In the meantime, we suggest you check out our
'classic' release of DART which is the Lanai release plus additional
development features.  All new development will be based on the
Manhattan release but the 'classic' release will remain for those
models which already have the necessary features.

Existing users will see that we have rearranged our directory tree.
We hope this helps you find the various pieces that come with the
DART distribution.

Contact us for more help or for more information on other models already
using DART or for how to add your model or observation types.

Thank you -
The DART Development Team.

Quick-start for the impatient:

Go into the 'build_templates' directory and copy over the closest
mkmf.template.compiler.system file into 'mkmf.template'.

Edit it to set the NETCDF directory location if not in /usr/local
or comment it out and set $NETCDF in your environment.  
*This NetCDF library must have been compiled with the same compiler
that you use to compile DART and must include the F90 interfaces.*

Go into 'models/lorenz_63/work' and run './quickbuild.csh'.

If it compiles, hooray.  Run this series of commands to do a very
basic test:

ncgen -o perfect_input.nc perfect_input.cdl
./perfect_model_obs
ncgen -o filter_input.nc filter_input.cdl
./filter

If that runs, hooray again.  Finally, if you have Matlab installed on
your system add '$DART/diagnostics/matlab' to your matlab search path 
and run the 'plot_total_err' diagnostic script while in the 
'models/lorenz_63/work' directory.  If the output plots and looks 
reasonable (error level stays around 2 and doesn't grow unbounded) 
you're great!  Congrats.

If you are planning to run one of the larger models and want to
use the Lorenz 63 model as a test, run './quickbuild.csh -mpi'.
It will build filter and any other MPI-capable executables with MPI.
*The 'mpif90' command you use must have been built with the same 
version of the compiler as you are using.*


If any of these steps fail or you don't know how to do them, go to the
DART project web page listed above for very detailed instructions that
should get you over any bumps in the process.
