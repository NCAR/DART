# DART 

Welcome to DART, the **Data Assimilation Research Testbed**. DART is an open-source, 
freely available community facility for ensemble data assimilation (DA). 

[The DART documentation is available online](https://dart-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

There is a mailing list where we summarize updates to the DART repository and notify users about 
recent bug fixes. It is not generally used for discussion so it's a low-traffic list. 
To subscribe to the list, click on [Dart-users](http://mailman.ucar.edu/mailman/listinfo/dart-users).
