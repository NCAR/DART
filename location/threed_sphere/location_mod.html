<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>
The DART framework needs to be able to compute distances
between locations, to pass location information to and from the
model interface code (model_mod.f90), and to be able to
read and write location information to files.
DART isolates all this location information into separate modules 
so that the main algorithms can operate with the same code independent
of whether the model uses latitude/longitude/height, 1D unit
sphere coordinates, cylindrical coordinates, etc.  DART provides
about half a dozen possible coordinate systems, and others can be added.  
The most common one for geophysical models is this one: threed_sphere.
</P> <P>
This location module provides a representation of a physical location 
on a 3-D spherical shell, using latitude and longitude plus a vertical
component with choices of vertical coordinate type such as pressure or 
height in meters.
A type that abstracts the location is provided along
with operators to set, get, read, write, and compute distances between 
locations. This is a member of a class of similar location modules that 
provide the same abstraction for different represenations of physical space.
</P>
<H4>Location-independent code</H4>
<P>
All types of location modules define the same module name 
<em class=code>location_mod</em>.  Therefore, the DART framework and any
user code should include a Fortran 90
<em class=code>use</em> statement of <em class=code>location_mod</em>.  
The selection of which
location module will be compiled into the program
is controlled by which source file name is specified 
in the <em class=file>path_names_xxx</em> file, which is used by
the <em class=file>mkmf_xxx</em> scripts.
</P> <P>
All types of location modules define the same Fortran 90 derived type
<em class=code>location_type</em>.
Programs that need to pass location information to subroutines
but do not need to interpret the contents can declare, receive, and pass this
derived type around in their code independent of which location module
is specified at compile time.  Model and location-independent utilities
should be written in this way.
However, as soon as the contents of the location type needs to
be accessed by user code then it becomes dependent on the
exact type of location module that it is compiled with.
</P>
<H4>Usage of distance routines</H4>
<A NAME="Distance"></A>
<P>
Regardless of the fact that the distance subroutine names include the string 'obs', 
there is nothing specific to observations in these routines.  They work to
compute distances between any set of locations.  The most frequent use
of these routines in the filter code is to compute the distance between
a single observation and items in the state vector, and also between a single
observation and other nearby observations.
However, any source for locations is supported.
</P> <P>
In simpler location modules (like the <em class=file>oned</em> version)
there is no need for anything other than a brute force search between
the base location and all available state vector locations.  However in
the case of large geophysical models which typically
use the <em class=file>threed_sphere</em>
locations code, the brute-force search time is prohibitive.  
The location code pre-processes all locations into a set of <em>bins</em>
and then only needs to search the lists of locations in nearby bins when looking
for locations that are within a specified distance.
</P> <P>
The expected calling sequence of the <em class=code>get_close</em> routines 
is as follows:
</P>
<pre>
<em class=code>
call get_close_maxdist_init()  ! is called before get_close_obs_init()
call get_close_obs_init()
...
call get_close_obs()           ! called many, many times
...
call get_close_obs_destroy()
</em>
</pre>
<P>
In the <em class=file>threed_sphere</em> implementation the
first routine initializes some data structures, the second one
bins up the list of locations, and then the third one is called
multiple times to find all locations within a given radius of
some reference location, and to optionally
compute the exact separation distance from the reference location.
The last routine deallocates the space.  See the documentation 
below for the specific details for each routine.
</P> <P>
All 4 of these routines must be present in every location module
but in most other versions
all but <em class=code>get_close_obs()</em> are stubs.
In this <em class=file>threed_sphere</em> version
of the locations module all are fully implemented.
</P>
<H4>Interaction with model_mod.f90 code</H4>
<A NAME="ModelMod"></A>
<P>
The filter and other DART programs could call the 
<em class=code>get_close</em> routines directly, but typically
do not.  They declare them (in a <em class=code>use</em> statement)
to be in the <em class=code>model_mod</em> module, and all
model interface modules are required to supply them.  However
in many cases the model_mod only needs to contain another
<em class=code>use</em> statement declaring them to come
from the <em class=code>location_mod</em> module.
Thus they 'pass through' the model_mod but the user does
not need to provide a subroutine or any code for them.
</P> <P>
However, if the model interface code wants to intercept and alter
the default behavior of the get_close routines, it is able to.
Typically the model_mod still calls the location_mod routines and
then adjusts the results before passing them back to the calling code.
To do that, the model_mod must be able to call the routines in
the location_mod which have the same names as the subroutines it
is providing.  To allow the compiler to distinguish which routine
is to be called where, we use the Fortran 90 feature which allows
a module routine to be renamed in the use statement.  For example,
a common case is for the model_mod to want to supply additions to
the get_close_obs() routine only.  At the top of the model_mod code
it would declare:
</P>
<pre>
<em class=code>
use location_mod, only :: location_get_close_obs => get_close_obs,    &amp;
                          get_close_maxdist_init, get_close_obs_init, &amp;
                          get_close_obs_destroy
</em>
</pre>
<P>
That makes calls to the maxdist_init, init, and destroy routines simply pass
through to the code in the location_mod, but the model_mod must supply
a get_close_obs() subroutine.  When it wants to call the code in the 
location_mod it calls <em class=code>location_get_close_obs()</em>.
</P> <P>
One use pattern is for the model_mod to call the location get_close_obs()
routine without the <em class=code>dist</em> argument.  This returns a list
of any potentially close locations without computing the exact distance
from the base location.  At this point the list of locations is a copy
and the model_mod routine is free to alter the list in any way it chooses:
it can change the locations to make certain types of locations appear
closer or further away from the base location; it can convert the vertical
coordinates into a common coordinate type so that calls to the 
<em class=code>get_dist()</em> routine can do full 3d distance computations
and not just 2d (the vertical coordinates must match between the base
location and the locations in the list in order to compute a 3d distance).
Then typically the model_mod code loops over the list calling the
<em class=code>get_dist()</em> routine to get the actual distances
to be returned to the calling code.  To localize in the vertical in a
particular unit type, this is the place where the conversion to that
vertical unit should be done.
</P>
<H4>Horizontal Distance Only</H4>
<P>
If <em>horiz_distance_only</em> is .true. in the namelist then the
vertical coordinate is ignored and only the great-circle distance
between the two locations is computed, as if they were both on the
surface of the sphere. 
</P> <P>
If <em>horiz_distance_only</em> is .false. in the namelist
then the appropriate normalization constant determines the relative impact of
vertical and horizontal separation.  Since only a single localization
distance is specified, and the vertical scales might have very different
distance characteristics, the vert_normalization_xxx values can be used
to scale the vertical appropriately to control the desired influence 
of observations in the vertical.
</P>
<H4>Precomputation for Run-time Search Efficiency</H4>
<P>
For search efficiency all locations are pre-binned. The surface of the
sphere is divided up into <em>nlon</em> by <em>nlat</em> boxes and the
index numbers of all items (both state vector entries and observations)
are stored in the appropriate box.  
To locate all points close to a given location, only the locations
listed in the boxes within the search radius must be checked.  
This speeds up the computations, for example, when localization controls
which state vector items are impacted by any given observation.  The search
radius is the localization distance and only those state vector items
in boxes closer than the radius to the observation location are processed.
</P> <P>
The default values have given good performance on many of our
existing model runs, but for tuning purposes the box counts
have been added to the namelist to allow adjustment.  
By default the code prints some summary information about how full
the average box is, how many are empty, and how many items were in the
box with the largest count.  
The namelist value <em>output_box_info</em> can be set to .true. to
get even more information about the box statistics.
The best performance will be obtained somewhere between two extremes;
the worst extreme is all the
points are located in just a few boxes.  This degenerates into a (slow)
linear search through the index list.  The other extreme is a large
number of empty or sparsely filled boxes.  The overhead of creating,
managing, and searching a long list of boxes will impact performance.
The best performance lies somewhere in the middle, where each box
contains a reasonable number of values, more or less evenly
distributed across boxes. 
The absolute numbers for best performance will certainly
vary from case to case.
</P> <P>
For latitude, the <em>nlat</em> boxes are distributed evenly across the
actual extents of the data. (Locations are in radians, so the
maximum limits are the poles at -PI/2 and +PI/2).   
For longitude, 
the code automatically determines if the data is spread around more
than half the sphere, and if so, the boxes are
distributed evenly across the entire sphere (longitude range 0 to 2*PI).  
If the data spans less than half the sphere in longitude, 
the actual extent of the data is determined (including correctly
handling the cyclic boundary at 0) and the boxes are 
distributed only within the data extent.
This simplifies the actual distance calculations 
since the distance from the minimum longitude box to the
maximum latitude box cannot be shorter going the other way around the sphere.
<!-- (Computing distances going over the poles still must be considered.) -->
In practice, for a global model the boxes are evenly distributed
across the entire surface of the sphere.  
For local or regional models, the boxes
are distributed only across the the extent of the local grid.
</P> <P>
For efficiency in the case where the boxes span less than half the globe,
the 3D location module needs to be able to determine the greatest longitude 
difference between a base point at latitude <tt>&phi;<sub>s</sub></tt>
and all points that are separated from that point by a central 
angle of <tt>&theta;</tt>. 
We might also want to know the latitude, <tt>&phi;<sub>f</sub></tt> , 
at which the largest separation occurs. Note also that an intermediate 
form below allows the computation of the maximum longitude difference 
at a particular latitude.
</P> <P>
The central angle between a point at latitude <tt>&phi;<sub>s</sub></tt>
and a second point at latitude <tt>&phi;<sub>f</sub></tt> that are separated 
in longitude by <tt>&Delta;&lambda;</tt> is <br> <br>
<tt>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&theta; = cos<sup>-1</sup>(sin&phi;<sub>s</sub>sin&phi;<sub>f</sub> + 
   cos&phi;<sub>s</sub>cos&phi;<sub>f</sub>cos&Delta;&lambda;) 
</tt> <br> <br>
Taking the cos of both sides gives <br> <br>
<tt>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cos&theta; = (sin&phi;<sub>s</sub>sin&phi;<sub>f</sub> +
   cos&phi;<sub>s</sub>cos&phi;<sub>f</sub>cos&Delta;&lambda;)
</tt> <br> <br>
Solving for <tt>cos&Delta;&lambda;</tt> gives <br> <br>
<tt>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cos&Delta;&lambda; 
    = <sup>(<i>a</i> - <i>b</i>&nbsp;sin&phi;<sub>f</sub>)</sup><big>/</big><sub>(<i>c</i>&nbsp;cos&phi;<sub>f</sub>)</sub>
    = <sup><i>a</i></sup><big>/</big><sub><i>c</i></sub>&nbsp;sec&phi;<sub>f</sub> - 
      <sup><i>b</i></sup><big>/</big><sub><i>c</i></sub>&nbsp;tan&phi;<sub>f</sub> 
</tt> <br> <br>
where <tt><i>a</i> = cos&theta;</tt> , 
<tt><i>b</i> = sin&phi;<sub>s</sub></tt> , 
and <tt><i>c</i> = cos&phi;<sub>s</sub></tt> . 
We want to maximize <tt>&Delta;&lambda;</tt> which implies minimizing   
<tt>cos&Delta;&lambda;</tt> subject to constraints. Taking the 
derivative with respect to <tt>&phi;<sub>f</sub></tt> gives  <br> <br>
<tt>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>(<i>d</i>&nbsp;cos&Delta;&lambda;)</sup><big>/</big><sub>(<i>d</i>&phi;<sub>f</sub>)</sub> = 
   <sup><i>a</i></sup><big>/</big><sub><i>c</i></sub>&nbsp;sec&phi;<sub>f</sub>&nbsp;tan&phi;<sub>f</sub>
 - <sup><i>b</i></sup><big>/</big><sub><i>c</i></sub>&nbsp;sec<sup>2</sup>&phi;<sub>f</sub> = 0
</tt> <br> <br>
Factoring out <tt>sec&phi;<sub>f</sub></tt> which can never be 0 and using the
definitions of <tt>sec</tt> and <tt>tan</tt> gives <br> <br>
<tt>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>(<i>a</i>&nbsp;sin&phi;<sub>f</sub>)</sup><big>/</big><sub>(<i>c</i>&nbsp;cos&phi;<sub>f</sub>)</sub> -
<sup><i>b</i></sup><big>/</big><sub>(<i>c</i>&nbsp;cos&phi;<sub>f</sub>)</sub> = 0
</tt> <br> <br>
Solving in the constrained range from 0 to PI/2 gives <br> <br>
<tt>
&nbsp;&nbsp; sin&phi;<sub>f</sub> = <sup><i>b</i></sup><big>/</big><sub><i>a</i></sub> = 
   <sup>sin&phi;<sub>s</sub></sup><big>/</big><sub>cos&theta;</sub>
</tt> <br> <br>
So knowing 
base point (<tt>&phi;<sub>s</sub></tt>,
<tt>&lambda;<sub>s</sub></tt>),
latitude <tt>&phi;<sub>f</sub></tt>, and
distance <tt>&theta;</tt> we can use the great circle equation to find
the longitude difference at the greatest separation point <br> <br>
<tt>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &Delta;&lambda; = cos<sup>-1</sup><big>(</big><sup>(<i>a</i> - 
(<i>b</i>&nbsp;sin&phi;<sub>f</sub>))</sup> 
 <big>/</big> <sub>(<i>c</i>&nbsp;cos&phi;<sub>f</sub>)</sub><big>)</big>
</tt> <br> <br>
Note that if the angle between the base point and a pole is less than 
or equal to the central angle, all longitude differences will occur 
as the pole is approached.

    <TD>If .TRUE. compute great-circle distance using the horizontal distance component only.

All distances are computed in radians; the corresponding vertical normalization

The vertical coordinate system must be the same for both locations in order
to compute a distance.  However, if either location is VERTISUNDEF, or both are
VERTISSURFACE, only a horizontal distance is computed.  For any other combination
of vertical coordinate systems this routine will fail because it cannot convert
between vertical coordinate systems without model-specific information.
The model_mod interface code may supply a get_close_obs() routine to intercept

Given a single location and a list of other locations, returns the indices
of all the locations close to the single one along with the number of
these and the distances for the close ones.  The list of locations
passed in via the <em class=code>obs</em> argument must be identical to
the list of <em class=code>obs</em> passed into the most recent call
to <em class=code>get_close_obs_init()</em>.  If the list of locations
of interest changes <em class=code>get_close_obs_destroy()</em> must
be called and then the two initialization routines must be called 
before using <em class=code>get_close_obs()</em> again.
</P>
<P>
Note that the base location is passed with the specific type associated
with that location.  The list of potential close locations is matched
with a list of generic kinds.  This is because in the current usage in
the DART system the base location is always associated with an actual
observation, which has both a specific type and generic kind.  The list
of potentially close locations is used both for other observation locations
but also for state variable locations which only have a generic kind.
</P>
<P>
If called without the optional <em class=optionalcode>dist</em> argument,
all locations that are potentially close are returned, which is likely a
superset of the locations that are within the threshold distance specified in
the <em class=code>get_close_maxdist_init()</em> call.  This can be
useful to collect a list of potential locations, and then to convert
all the vertical coordinates into one consistent unit (pressure, height
in meters, etc), and then the list can be looped over, calling
get_dist() directly to get the exact distance, either including vertical
or not depending on the setting of <em class=code>horiz_dist_only</em>.

This routine should perhaps be renamed to something like
'using_vertical_for_distance' or something similar.  The current
use for it is in the localization code inside filter, but that
doesn't make this a representative function name.  And at least
in current usage, returning the
opposite setting of the namelist item makes the code read
more direct (fewer double negatives).

<H2>KNOWN BUGS</H2>
<P>
The Hawaii and Workshop versions of this module had an error in the
approximate distance computation. The available values in the lookup
table for cosine were insufficient for some cases. This manifested 
itself as potential errors, most commonly for computing distances 
near the poles. For relatively small horizontal localizations, this 
problem only occurred for locations very near the pole.

<div class="top">[<a href="#">top</a>]</div><hr />
<H2>FUTURE PLANS</H2>
<P>
Need to provide more efficient algorithms for getting close locations
and document the nlon and nlat choices and their impact on cost.
</P>
<P>
The collection of 'val = vert_is_xxx()' routines should probably be replaced
by a single call 'val = vert_is(loc, VERTISxxx)'.
</P>
<P>
See the note in the 'has_vertical_localization()' about a better
name for this routine.
</P>
<P>
The functions of 'get_close_maxdist_init()' and 'get_close_obs_init()'
appear to be able to be combined into a single init routine.  This 
impacts all model_mods, however, since they can intercept these routines.
Doing this will be a non-backwards compatible change.
</P>
<P>
The use of 'obs' in all these routine names should probably be
changed to 'loc' since there is no particular dependence that
they be observations.  They may need to have an associated DART
kind, but these routines are used for DART state vector entries
so it's misleading to always call them 'obs'.
</P>
