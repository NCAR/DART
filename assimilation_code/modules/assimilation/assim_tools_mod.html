<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>
This module provides subroutines that implement the parallel versions
of the sequential scalar filter algorithms. These include the standard
sequential filter as described in
<a href="#References"> Anderson 2001, 2003 </a> along with systematic
correction algorithms for both mean and spread. In addition, algorithms
to do a variety of flavors of filters including the EAKF, ENKF, particle
filter, and kernel filters are included. The parallel implementation
that allows each observation to update all state variables that are close
to it at the same time is described in
<a href="#References">Anderson and Collins, 2007</a>.
</P>

<A NAME="FilterTypes"></A>
<H4>Filter Types</H4>
<P>
Available observation space filter types include:
</P>
<ul>
<li> 1 = EAKF (Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter, see
<a href="#References"> Anderson 2001</a>)
<li> 2 = ENKF (Ensemble Kalman Filter)
<li> 3 = Kernel filter
<li> 4 = Observation Space Particle filter
<li> 5 = Random draw from posterior  (contact dart@ucar.edu before using)
<li> 6 = Deterministic draw from posterior with fixed kurtosis (ditto)
<li> 7 = Boxcar kernel filter
<li> 8 = Rank Histogram filter (see
<a href="#References"> Anderson 2010</a>)
<li> 9 = Particle filter (see
<a href="#References"> Poterjoy 2016</a>)
</ul>
<P>
We recommend using type=1, the EAKF.
Note that although the algorithm
is expressed in a slightly different form,
the EAKF is identical to the
EnSRF (Ensemble Square Root Filter)
described by Whitaker and Hamill in 2002.
Highly non-gaussian distributions may get
better results from type=8, Rank Histogram filter.
</P>


<A NAME="Localization"></A>
<H4>Localization</H4>
<P>
<em>Localization</em> controls how far the impact of an observation extends.
The namelist items related to localization are spread over several
different individual namelists, so we have made a single collected
description of them here along with some guidance on setting the values.
</P> <P>
This discussion centers on the mechanics of how you control
localization in DART with the namelist items, and a little bit about
pragmatic approaches to picking the values.  There is no discussion
about the theory behind localization - contact Jeff Anderson for more
details.
Additionally, the discussion here applies specifically to models using
the 3d-sphere location module.  The same process takes place in 1d
models but the details of the location module namelist is different.
</P> <P>
The following namelist items related to 3d-sphere localization
are all found in the <em class=file>input.nml</em> file:
</P>
<dl>
<dt>
<em>&amp;assim_tools_nml :: cutoff</em><br />
valid values: 0.0 to infinity
<dd>
This is the value, in radians, of the half-width of the localization
radius (this follows the terminology of an early paper on localization).
For each observation, a state vector item increment is computed based
on the covariance values.  Then a multiplier, based on the 'select_localization'
setting (see below) decreases the increment as the distance
between the obs and the state vector item increases.  In all cases
if the distance exceeds 2*cutoff, the increment is 0.
<br /> <br />
<dt>
<em>&amp;cov_cutoff_nml :: select_localization</em><br />
valid values: 1=Gaspari-Cohn; 2=Boxcar; 3=Ramped Boxcar
<dd>
Controls the shape of the multiplier function applied to the
computed increment as the distance increases between the obs
and the state vector item.
Most users use type 1 localization.
<table border=0 summary="" cellpadding=0>
<tr><td><ul>
        <li>Type 1 (Gaspari-Cohn) has a value of 1 at 0 distance, 0 at 2*cutoff, and
            decreases in an approximation of a gaussian in between.
            <br /> <br />
        <li>Type 2 (Boxcar) is 1 from 0 to 2*cutoff, and then 0 beyond.
        <br /> <br />
        <li>Type 3 (Ramped Boxcar) is 1 to cutoff and then ramps linearly down to 0 at 2*cutoff.
        </ul>

</tr>
</table>
<dt>
<em>&amp;location_nml :: horiz_dist_only</em><br />
valid values:  .true., .false.
<dd>
If set to .true., then the vertical location of all items, observations
and state vector both, are ignored when computing distances
between pairs of locations.  This has the effect that all items within
a vertical-cylindrical area are considered the same distance away.
<br /> <br />
If set to .false., then the full 3d separation is computed.  Since
the localization is computed in radians, the 2d distance is easy
to compute but a scaling factor must be given for the vertical
since vertical coordinates can be in meters, pressure, or model levels.
See below for the 'vert_normalization_xxx' namelist items.
<br /> <br />
<dt>
<em>&amp;location_nml :: vert_normalization_{pressure,height,level,scale_height}</em><br />
valid values: real numbers, in pascals, meters, index, and value respectively
<dd>
If 'horiz_dist_only' is set to .true., these are ignored.  If set to .false.,
these are required.  They are the amount of that quantity that is
equivalent to 1 radian in the horizontal.  If the model is an
earth-based one, then one radian is roughly 6366 kilometers, so if
vert_normalization_height is set to 6366000 meters, then the localization
cutoff will be a perfect sphere.  If you want to localize over a larger
distance in the vertical than horizontal, use a larger value.  If you want
to localize more sharply in the vertical, use a smaller number.
The type of localization used is set by which type of vertical coordinate
the observations and state vector items have.
<br /> <br />
If you have observations with different vertical coordinates (e.g. pressure
and height), or if your observations have a different vertical coordinate
than your state vector items, or if you want to localize in a different
type of unit than your normal vertical coordinate (e.g. your model uses
pressure in the vertical but you wish to localize in meters), then you
will need to modify or add a <em class=code>get_close()</em> routine
in your <em class=file>model_mod.f90</em> file.  See the discussion in
the <a href="../../location/threed_sphere/location_mod.html">location module</a>
documentation for how to transform vertical coordinates before localization.
<br /> <br />
<dt>
<em>&amp;assim_tools_nml :: adaptive_localization_threshold</em><br />
valid values: integer counts, or -1 to disable
<dd>
Used to dynamically shrink the localization cutoff in areas of dense
observations.  If set to something larger than 0, first the number of
other observations within 2*cutoff is computed.  If it is larger than this
given threshold, the cutoff is decreased proportionally so if the
observations were evenly distributed in space, the number of
observations within 2*revised_cutoff
would now be the threshold value.  The cutoff value is computed
for each observation as it is assimilated, so can be different for
each one.
<br /> <br />
<dt>
<em>&amp;assim_tools_nml :: adaptive_cutoff_floor</em><br />
valid values: 0.0 to infinity, or -1 to disable
<dd>
If using adaptive localization (adaptive_localization_threshold
set to a value greater than 0), then this value can be used to
set a minimum cutoff distance below which the adaptive code will
not shrink.  Set to -1 to disable.  Ignored if not using
adaptive localization.
<br /> <br />
<dt>
<em>&amp;assim_tools_nml :: output_localization_diagnostics</em><br />
valid values: .true., .false.
<dd>
If .true. and if adaptive localization is on, a single text line is printed
to a file giving the original cutoff and number of observations, and the
revised cutoff and new number of counts within this smaller cutoff for any
observation which has nearby observations which exceed the adaptive threshold count.
<br /> <br />
<dt>
<em>&amp;assim_tools_nml :: localization_diagnostics_file </em><br />
valid values: text string
<dd>
Name of the file where the adaptive localization diagnostic
information is written.
<br /> <br />
<dt>
<em>&amp;assim_tools_nml :: special_localization_obs_types </em><br />
valid values: list of 1 or more text strings
<dd>
The cutoff localization setting is less critical in DART than
it might be in other situations since during the assimilation DART
computes the covariances between observations and nearby state
vector locations and that is the major factor in controlling the
impact an observation has.  For conventional observations
fine-tuning the cutoff based on observation type is not recommended
(it is possible to do more harm than good with it).
But in certain special cases
there may be valid reasons to want to change the localization cutoff
distances drastically for certain kinds of observations.  This and
the following namelist items allow this.
<br /> <br />
Optional list of observation types (e.g. "RADAR_REFLECTIVITY",
"AIRS_TEMPERATURE") which will use a different cutoff distance.
Any observation types not listed here will use the standard cutoff
distance (set by the 'cutoff' namelist value).  This is only
implemented for the threed_sphere location module (the one
used by most geophysical models.)
<br /> <br />
<dt>
<em>&amp;assim_tools_nml :: special_localization_cutoffs </em><br />
valid values: list of 1 or more real values, 0.0 to infinity
<dd>
A list of real values, the same length as the list of observation
types, to be used as the cutoff value for each of the given
observation types.  This is only
implemented for the threed_sphere location module (the one
used by most geophysical models.)
</dd>
</dl>
<P>
There are a large set of options for localization.  Individual cases
may differ but in general the following guidelines might help.
Most users use the Gaspari-Cohn covariance cutoff type.
The value of the cutoff itself is the
item most often changed in a sensitivity run to pick a good general
value, and then left as-is for subsequent runs.
Most localize in the vertical, but tend to use large values so as to
not disturb vertical structures.
Users do not generally use adaptive localization, unless their
observations are very dense in some areas and sparse in others.
</P>
<P>
The advice for setting good values for the cutoff value is to err
on the larger side - to estimate for all types of observations under all
conditions what the farthest feasible impact or correlated structure size
would be.  The downsides of guessing too large are 1) run time is slower,
and 2) there can be spurious correlations between state vector items and
observations
which aren't physically related and noise can creep into the assimilation
results this way.   The downside of guessing too small is that state vector
items that should get an impact from an observation won't.  This might
disrupt organized features in a field and the model may take more time
to recover/reconstruct the feature.

<TBODY valign=top>
<TR>
 <TD> filter_kind </TD>
 <TD> integer </TD>
 <TD> Selects the variant of filter to be used.
<UL>
<li> 1 = EAKF (Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter, see
<a href="#References"> Anderson 2001</a>)
<li> 2 = ENKF (Ensemble Kalman Filter)
<li> 3 = Kernel filter
<li> 4 = Observation Space Particle filter

<li> 9 = Particle filter (see
<a href="#References"> Poterjoy 2016</a>)
<br /> <br />

The EAKF is the most commonly used filter. 
Note that although the algorithm is expressed in a slightly different 
form, the EAKF is identical to the EnSRF (Ensemble Square Root Filter)
described by Whitaker and Hamill in 2002.
<br /> <br />

The Rank Histgram filter can be more successful for highly nongaussian
distributions. 
<br /> <br />

Jon Poterjoy's Particle filter is included with this code release.
To use it rename assimilation_code/modules/assimilation/assim_tools_mod.pf.f90 to
assim_tools_mod.f90 and rebuild filter.  There are additional namelist items in
this version specific to the particle filter.  Read the code for more details.
 </TD> </TR>

<TR>
 <TD> cutoff </TD>
 <TD> real(r8) </TD>
 <TD> Cutoff controls a distance dependent weight that modulates
the impact of an observation on a state variable. The units depend
both on the location module being used and on the covariance cutoff
module options selected.  As defined in the original paper, this is
the half-width; the localization goes to 0 at 2 times this value.
 </TD> </TR>

<TR>
 <TD> distribute_mean </TD>
 <TD> logical </TD>
 <TD> If your model uses coordinates that have no options for
different vertical coordinates then this setting has no effect
on speed and should be .true. to use less memory.  If your model
has code to convert between different coordinate systems, for
example Pressure, Height, Model Levels, etc, then setting this
.false. will generally run much faster at assimilation time
but will require more memory per MPI task.  If you run out of
memory, setting this to .true. may allow you to run but take
longer.
 </TD> </TR>

<TR>
 <TD> sort_obs_inc </TD>
 <TD> logical </TD>
 <TD> If true, the final increments from obs_increment are sorted
so that the mean increment value is as small as possible. This minimizes
regression errors when non-deterministic filters or error correction algorithms
are applied. HOWEVER, when using deterministic filters (filter_kind == 1 or 8)
with no inflation or a combination of a determinstic filter and deterministic
inflation (filter_nml:inf_deterministic = .TRUE.) sorting the increments is
both unnecessary and expensive. A warning is printed to stdout and the log and
the sorting is skipped.
 </TD> </TR>

<TR>
 <TD> spread_restoration </TD>
 <TD> logical </TD>
 <TD> True turns on algorithm to restore amount of spread that would be
expected to be lost if underlying obs/state variable correlation were really 0.
 </TD> </TR>

<TR>
 <TD> sampling_error_correction </TD>
 <TD> logical </TD>
 <TD>
If true, apply sampling error corrections to the correlation values
based on the ensemble size.
See <a href="#References"> Anderson 2012</a>.
This option uses special input files generated by the gen_sampling_err_table
tool in the assimilation_code/programs directory.
The values are generated for a specific ensemble size
and most common ensemble sizes have precomputed entries in the table.
There is no dependence on which model is being used, only on the number of
ensemble members.  The input file must exist in the directory where the filter
program is executing. 
 </TD> </TR>

<TR>
 <TD> adaptive_localization_threshold </TD>
 <TD> integer </TD>
 <TD> Used to reduce the impact of observations in densely observed
regions. If the number of observations close to a given observation is greater
than the threshold number, the cutoff radius for localization is adjusted to
try to make the number of observations close to the given observation be
the threshold number. This should be dependent on the location module and
is tuned for a three_dimensional spherical implementation for numerical
weather prediction models at present.
 </TD> </TR>

<TR>
 <TD> adaptive_cutoff_floor </TD>
 <TD> real </TD>
 <TD> If adaptive localization is enabled and if this value is
greater than 0, then the adaptive cutoff distance will be set to a value no
smaller than the distance specified here.  This guarentees a minimum cutoff
value even in regions of very dense observations.
 </TD> </TR>

<TR>
 <TD> output_localization_diagnostics </TD>
 <TD> logical </TD>
 <TD> Setting this to true. will output an additional text
file that contains the obs key, the obs time, the obs location, the
cutoff distance and the number of other obs which are within that radius.
If adaptive localization is enabled, the output also contains the updated
cutoff distance and the number of other obs within that new radius.  Without
adaptive localization there will be a text line for each observation,
so this file could get very large.  With adaptive localization enabled,
there will only be one line per observation where the radius is changed,
so the size of the file will depend on the number of changed cutoffs.
 </TD> </TR>


<TR>
 <TD> localization_diagnostics_file </TD>
 <TD> character(len=129) </TD>
 <TD> Filename for the localization diagnostics information.
This file will be opened in append mode, so new information will be written
at the end of any existing data.
 </TD> </TR>


<TR>
 <TD> print_every_nth_obs </TD>
 <TD> integer </TD>
 <TD> If set to a value <em class=code>N</em> greater than 0,
the observation assimilation loop prints out a progress message
every <em class=code>N</em>th observations.  This can be useful to
estimate the expected run time for a large observation file,
or to verify progress is being made in cases with suspected problems.
 </TD> </TR>


<TR>
 <TD> rectangular_quadrature </TD>
 <TD> logical </TD>
 <TD> Only relevant for filter type 8 and recommended to leave .true.
 </TD> </TR>


<TR>
 <TD> gaussian_likelihood_tails </TD>
 <TD> logical </TD>
 <TD> Only relevant for filter type 8 and recommended to leave .false.
 </TD> </TR>


<TR>
 <TD> close_obs_caching </TD>
 <TD> logical </TD>
 <TD> Should remain .TRUE. unless you are using
specialized_localization_cutoffs.  In that case to get accurate
results, set it to .FALSE..  This also needs to be .FALSE. if
you have a get_close_obs() routine in your model_mod file
that uses the types/kinds of the obs to adjust the distances.
 </TD> </TR>


<TR>
 <TD> allow_missing_in_clm </TD>
 <TD> logical </TD>
 <TD> If true, missing values (MISSING_R8 as defined in the types_mod.f90
file) are allowed in the state vector.  Model interpolation routines
must be written to recognize this value and fail the interpolation. 
During assimilation any state vector items where one or more of the 
ensemble members are missing will be skipped and their values will 
be unchanged by the assimilation.  The system currently has limited
support for this option; the CLM model has been tested and is known
to work.  Other users with models which would benefit from setting missing
values in the state vector are encouraged to contact
<a href="mailto:dart@ucar.edu">dart at ucar.edu</a>.
 </TD> </TR>


<TR>
 <TD> adjust_obs_impact </TD>
 <TD> logical </TD>
 <TD> If true, reads a table of observation quantities and types
which should be artifically adjusted regardless of the actual
correlation computed during assimilation.  Setting the impact
value to 0 prevents items from being adjusted by that class of observations.
The input file can be constructed by the 'obs_impact_tool' program,
included in this release. See the documentation for more details.
 </TD> </TR>


<TR>
 <TD> obs_impact_filename </TD>
 <TD> character(len=256) </TD>
 <TD> If adjust_obs_impact is true, the name of the file with
the observation types and quantities and state quantities that
should have have an additional factor applied to the correlations
during assimilation.
 </TD> </TR>


<TR>
 <TD> allow_any_impact_values </TD>
 <TD> logical </TD>
 <TD> If .false., then the impact values can only be zero or one (0.0 or 1.0)
- any other value will throw an error. .false. is the recommended setting.
 </TD> </TR>


<TR>
 <TD> convert_all_obs_verticals_first </TD>
 <TD> logical </TD>
 <TD> Should generally always be left .True..  For models without
vertical conversion choices the setting of this item has no impact.
 </TD> </TR>


<TR>
 <TD> convert_all_state_verticals_first </TD>
 <TD> logical </TD>
 <TD> If the model has multiple choices for the vertical coordinate
system during localization (e.g. pressure, height, etc) then this
should be .true. if previous versions of get_state_meta_data() did
a vertical conversion or if most of the state is going to be impacted
by at least one observation.  If only part of the state is going to
be updated or if get_state_meta_data() never used to do vertical 
conversions, leave it .false..  The results should be the same
but the run time may be impacted by doing unneeded conversions
up front.  For models without vertical conversion choices the
setting of this item has no impact.
 </TD> </TR>


<TR>
 <TD> special_localization_obs_types </TD>
 <TD> character(len=32), dimension(:) </TD>
 <TD> Optional list of observation types (e.g. "RADAR_REFLECTIVITY",
"RADIOSONDE_TEMPERATURE") which will use a different cutoff
value other than the default specified by the 'cutoff' namelist.
This is only implemented for the 'threed_sphere' locations module.
 </TD> </TR>


<TR>
 <TD> special_localization_cutoffs </TD>
 <TD> real(r8), dimension(:) </TD>
 <TD> Optional list of real values which must be the same
length and in the same order as the observation types list
given for the 'special_localization_obs_types' item.
These values will set a different cutoff distance for localization
based on the type of the observation currently being assimilated.
Any observation type not in the list will use the default cutoff value.
This is only implemented for the 'threed_sphere' locations module.
