<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>
   Main module for driving ensemble filter assimilations. 
   Used by filter.f90, perfect_model_obs.f90, model_mod_check.f90, 
   and a variety of test programs.
   See the <A href="../../programs/filter/filter.html">filter description</A>
   for a general description of filter capabilities and controls.
</P>
<P>
   <em class=program>filter_mod</em> is a Fortran 90 module, and provides a large
   number of options for controlling execution behavior and parameter configuration
   that are driven from its namelist. 
   See the <a href=#Namelist>namelist</a> section below for more details.
   The number of assimilation steps to be done 
   is controlled by the input observation sequence and by the 
   time-stepping capabilities of the model being used in the assimilation.
<P>
   See the <A href="http://www.image.ucar.edu/DAReS/DART">DART web site</A> 
   for more documentation, including a discussion of the capabilities of the
   assimilation system, a diagram of the entire execution cycle, the options
   and features.

Particular options to be aware of are:
async, ens_size, cutoff (localization radius), inflation flavor, outlier_threshold,
restart filenames (including inflation), obs_sequence_in_name, horiz_dist_only,
binary or ascii controls for observation sequence file formats.
Some of these important items are located in other namelists, but all are in the
same input.nml file.

<P>
The inflation control variables are all dimensioned 2, 
the first value controls the prior inflation

<TBODY valign=top>
<TR><TD>single_file_in</TD>
    <TD>logical</TD>
    <TD>True means all ensemble members are read from a single NetCDF file.  False means
    each member is in a separate file.  NOT SUPPORTED as of March, 2017
    only multiple files can be used.
 </TD></TR>

<TR><TD>input_state_files</TD>
    <TD>character(len=256) dimension(MAXFILES)</TD>
    <TD>A list of the NetCDF files to open to read the state vectors.
        Models using multiple domains must put the domain and ensemble numbers in the file names.
        The order and format of those is to be determined.
        NOT SUPPORTED as of March, 2017.
 </TD></TR>

<TR><TD>input_state_file_list</TD>
    <TD>character(len=256) dimension(MAXFILES)</TD>
    <TD>A list of files, one per domain.  Each file must be a text file containing
    the names of the NetCDF files to open, one per ensemble member, one per line.
 </TD></TR>

<TR><TD>init_time_days</TD>
    <TD>integer</TD>
    <TD>If negative, don't use. If non-negative, override the initial 
        days read from state data restart files. 
 </TD></TR>

<TR><TD>init_time_seconds</TD>
    <TD>integer</TD>
    <TD>If negative don't use. If non-negative, override the initial
        seconds read from state data restart files. 
 </TD></TR>

<TR><TD>perturb_from_single_instance</TD>
    <TD>logical</TD>
    <TD>False means start from an ensemble-sized set of restart files. 
        True means perturb a single state vector from one restart file. 
        This may be done by model_mod, if model_mod provides subroutine
        <em class=code>pert_model_copies</em>.
 </TD></TR>

<TR><TD>perturbation_amplitude</TD>
    <TD>real(r8)</TD>
    <TD>Standard deviation for the gaussian noise added when generating
        perturbed ensemble members.  Ignored if 
        <em class=code>perturb_from_single_instance&nbsp;=&nbsp;.false.</em>
        or the perturbed ensemble is created in model_mod.
      <br />Random noise values drawn from a gaussian distribution with this
      standard deviation will be added to the data in a single initial
      ensemble member to generate the rest of the members.
      <br />This option is more frequently used in the low order models
      and less frequently used in large models.  This is in part due
      to the different scales of real geophysical variable values, and the
      resulting inconsistencies between related field values.
      A more successful initial condition generation
      strategy is to generate climatological distributions from long model
      runs which have internally consistent structures and values and then
      use observations with a 'spin-up' period of assimilation to shape
      the initial states into a set of members with enough spread and which
      match the current set of observations.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>stages_to_write</TD>
    <TD>character(len=10) dimension(4)</TD>

 </TD></TR>

<TR><TD>single_file_out</TD>
    <TD>logical</TD>
    <TD>True means all ensemble members are written to a single NetCDF file.  False means
    each member is output in a separate file.  NOT SUPPORTED as of March, 2017 - only multiple files
    can be used.
 </TD></TR>

<TR><TD>output_state_files</TD>
    <TD>character(len=256) dimension(MAXFILES)</TD>
    <TD>A list of the NetCDF files to open for writing updated state vectors.
        Models using multiple domains must put the domain and ensemble numbers in the file names.
        The order and format of those is to be determined.
        NOT SUPPORTED as of March, 2017.
 </TD></TR>

<TR><TD>output_state_file_list</TD>
    <TD>character(len=256) dimension(MAXFILES)</TD>
    <TD>A list of files, one per domain.  Each file must be a text file containing
    the names of the NetCDF files to open, one per ensemble member, one per line.

        assimilation time, N is output_interval.
 </TD></TR>

<TR><TD>output_members</TD>
    <TD>logical</TD>
    <TD>True means output the ensemble members in any stage that is enabled.
 </TD></TR>

<TR><TD>num_output_state_members</TD>
    <TD>integer</TD>
    <TD>Number of ensemble members to be included in the state 
        diagnostic output for stages 'preassim' and 'postassim'.
        output_members must be TRUE.
 </TD></TR>

<TR><TD>output_mean</TD>
    <TD>logical</TD>
    <TD>True means output the ensemble mean in any stage that is enabled.
 </TD></TR>

<TR><TD>output_sd</TD>
    <TD>logical</TD>
    <TD>True means output the ensemble standard deviation (spread) in any stage that is enabled.
 </TD></TR>

<TR><TD>write_all_stages_at_end</TD>
    <TD>logical</TD>
    <TD>For most cases this should be .false. and data will be output as it is
        generated for the 'preassim', 'postassim' diagnostics, and then restart
        data will be output at the end.  However, if I/O time dominates the runtime,
        setting this to .true. will store the data and it can all be written in parallel
        at the end of the execution.  This will require slightly more memory at
        runtime, but can lower the cost of the job significantly in some cases.
 </TD></TR>

<TR><TD>compute_posterior</TD>
    <TD>logical</TD>
    <TD>If .false., skip computing posterior forward operators and do not write
        posterior values in the obs_seq.final file.  Saves time and memory.
        Cannot enable posterior inflation and skip computing the posteriors.
        For backwards compatibility the default for this is .true.
 </TD></TR>

<TR><TD>ens_size</TD>
    <TD>integer</TD>
    <TD>Size of ensemble.
 </TD></TR>

<TR><TD>num_groups</TD>
    <TD>integer</TD>
    <TD>Number of groups for hierarchical filter.  It should evenly divide ens_size.
 </TD></TR>

<TR><TD>distributed_state</TD>
    <TD>logical</TD>
    <TD>True means the ensemble data is distributed across all tasks as it
        is read in, so a single task never has to have enough memory to store
        the data for an ensemble member.  Large models should always set this
        to .true., while for small models it may be faster to set this to .false.
        This is different from <em> &amp;assim_tools_mod :: distributed_mean </em>.
 </TD></TR>

 </TD></TR>

<TR><TD>inf_damping</TD>
    <TD>real(r8) dimension(2)</TD>
    <TD>Damping factor for inflation mean values.  
The difference between the current inflation value and 1.0 is multiplied by
this factor before the next assimilation cycle.  The value should be between
0.0 and 1.0.  Setting a value of 0.0 is full damping, which in fact
turns all inflation off by fixing the inflation value at 1.0.   A value
of 1.0 turns inflation damping off leaving the original inflation value
unchanged.
 </TD></TR>

<TR><TD>inf_sd_initial</TD>
    <TD>real(r8) dimension(2)</TD>
    <TD>Initial value of inflation standard deviation if not read 
        from restart file.  If &le; 0, do not update the inflation
        values, so they are time-constant.  If positive, the inflation
        values will adapt through time, so they are time-varying.
 </TD></TR>

<TR><TD>inf_sd_lower_bound</TD>
    <TD>real(r8) dimension(2)</TD>
    <TD>Lower bound for inflation standard deviation. 
        If using a negative value for <em class=code>sd_initial</em> 
        this should also be negative to preserve the setting.
 </TD></TR>
 
<TR><TD>inf_sd_max_change</TD>
    <TD>real(r8) dimension(2)</TD>
    <TD>For inflation type 5 (enhanced inflation), controls the maximum
        change of the inflation standard deviation when adapting for the
        next assimilation cycle.  The value should be between 1.0 and 2.0.
        1.0 prevents any changes, while 2.0 allows 100% change.
        For the enhanced inflation option, if the standard deviation 
        initial value is equal to the standard deviation
        lower bound the standard deviation will not adapt in time.
        See <A href="../../programs/filter/filter.html#Inflation">this section</A>
        for a discussion of how the standard deviation
        adapts based on different types of inflation.
 </TD></TR>
 
<TR><TD>trace_execution</TD>
    <TD>logical</TD>
    <TD>True means output very detailed messages about what routines
        are being called in the main filter loop.  Useful if a job
        hangs or otherwise doesn't execute as expected.
 </TD></TR>

<TR><TD>output_timestamps</TD>
    <TD>logical</TD>
    <TD>True means write timing information to the log before and after 
        the model advance and the observation assimilation phases.
 </TD></TR>

<TR><TD>output_forward_op_errors</TD>
    <TD>logical</TD>
    <TD> True means output errors from forward observation operators.  This is 
         the 'istatus' error return code from the model_interpolate routine.  
         An ascii text file 
         <em class=file>prior_forward_op_errors</em> and/or 
         <em class=file>post_forward_op_errors</em> will be
         created in the current directory.  For each ensemble member which returns a
         non-zero return code, a line will be written to this file.  Each line will
         have three values listed: the observation number, the ensemble member number,
         and the istatus return code.  Be cautious when turning this option on.  The
         number of lines in this file can be up to the number of observations times
         the number of ensemble members times the number of assimilation cycles
         performed.  This option is generally most useful when run with a small
         observation sequence file and a small number of ensemble members to diagnose
         forward operator problems.
    </TD></TR>

<TR><TD>write_obs_every_cycle</TD>
    <TD>logical</TD>
    <TD>For debug use; this option can significantly slow the execution of filter.
        True means to write the entire output observation sequence diagnostic file 
        each time through the main filter loop even though only observations with times
        up to and including the current model time will have been assimilated.
        Unassimilated observations have the value -888888.0 (the DART "missing value").  
        If filter crashes before finishing it may help to see the forward operator values 
        of observations that have been assimilated so far.
 </TD></TR>

<TR><TD>silence</TD>
    <TD>logical</TD>
    <TD>True means output almost no runtime messages.  Not recommended
        for general use, but can speed long runs of the lower order models
        if the execution time becomes dominated by the volume of output.

<H2>FUTURE PLANS</H2>
<P>
Many.  New assimilation algorithms, support for new observation
types, support for additional models, better performance on higher
numbers of MPI tasks...   The list is long.  Send email to
<a href="mailto:dart@ucar.edu">dart@ucar.edu</a> if you are
interested in additional functionality in DART.
