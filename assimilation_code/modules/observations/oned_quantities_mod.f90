! ! in this section, define the quantities of interest. the name must
! ! start with QTY_xxx and be less than 32 characters total.
! ! if there are units, min/max values, pdf, etc you can add one or
! ! more name=value pairs.  at this point there *cannot* be spaces
! ! around the equals sign.  the value can have spaces if it is
! ! surrounded by double quotes.  e.g. desc="assumes dry air density"

! ! comment lines (like these) can be added if they start with a second !
 
! BEGIN DART PREPROCESS QUANTITY DEFINITIONS
!
! ! QTY_STATE_VARIABLE is a generic quantity which is predefined
! ! by the system and available for code to use without needing
! ! a separate definition here. It is frequently used in models
! ! where the items in the state vector do not directly represent
! ! a physical quantity in the model.
! !
! ! These additional QTYs are available for more specialized cases.
! !
!
!   QTY_1D_INTEGRAL                  desc="compute value with an integral"
!   QTY_STATE_VAR_POWER              desc="raising a state value to a power"
!   QTY_LARGE_SCALE_STATE            desc="state varies with large time/space scale"
!   QTY_SMALL_SCALE_STATE            desc="state varies with small time/space scale"
