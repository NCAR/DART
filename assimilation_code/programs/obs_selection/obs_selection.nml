# selections_file is a list of obs_defs output from the obs_seq_coverage 
# utility.  (optionally can be a full obs_seq file.)
#
# tolerances in the horizontal are in degrees, and apply separately
# to longitude and latitude.  tolerances in the vertical are in:
#   surface: meters
#   pressure: pascals
#   height: meters
#   scaleheight: pressure ratio
#   levels: fractional model levels
