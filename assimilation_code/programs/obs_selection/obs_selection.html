<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>
This specialized tool selects a subset of input observations
from an observation sequence file.
For a more general purpose observation sequence file tool, see the
<a href="../obs_sequence_tool/obs_sequence_tool.html">obs_sequence_tool</a>.
This tool takes a selected list of observation
types, times, and locations, and extracts only the matching
observations out of one or more obs_sequence files.
The tool which creates the input selection file is usually
<a href="../obs_seq_coverage/obs_seq_coverage.html">obs_seq_coverage</a>.
Alternatively, the selection file can be a full observation
sequence file, in which case the types, times, and locations
of those observations are used as the selection criteria.
</P>
<P>
This tool processes each observation sequence file listed
in the input namelist <em class=code>filename_seq</em> or 
<em class=code>filename_seq_list</em>.  If the observation 
type, time and location matches an entry in the selection
file, it is copied through to the output.
Otherwise it is ignored.
</P>
<P>
The actions of the <em class=code>obs_selection</em> program
are controlled by a Fortran namelist, read from a file named
<em class=file>input.nml</em> in the current directory.  A detailed
description of each namelist item is described in the
<a href="#Namelist">namelist section</a> of this document.
The names used in this discussion refer to these namelist items.

<TBODY valign=top>

<TR><TD>filename_seq</TD>
    <TD>character(len=256), dimension(500)</TD>
    <TD>The array of names of the observation sequence files to process,
up to a max count of 500 files. (Specify only the actual number of input
files.  It is not necessary to specify 500 entries.)
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>filename_seq_list</TD>
    <TD>character(len=256)</TD>
    <TD>An alternative way to specify the list of input files.
The name of a text file which contains, one per line, the names of the
observation sequence files to process.  You can only specify one of
filename_seq OR filename_seq_list, not both.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>num_input_files</TD>
    <TD>integer</TD>
    <TD>Optional.  The number of observation sequence files to process.
Maximum of 500.  If 0, the length is set by the number of input files
given.  If non-zero, must match the given input file list length.
(Can be used to verify the right number of input files were processed.)
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>filename_out</TD>
    <TD>character(len=256)</TD>
    <TD>The name of the resulting output observation sequence file.
There is only a single output file from this tool.
If the input specifies multiple obs_seq input files, the results are concatinated 
into a single output file.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>selections_file</TD>
    <TD>character(len=256)</TD>
    <TD>The name of the input file containing the mask of observation
definitions (the textfile output of <a href="../obs_seq_coverage/obs_seq_coverage.html">obs_seq_coverage</a>).
Alternatively, this can be the name of a full observation sequence file.
In this case, the types, times, and locations are extracted from this
file and then used in the same manner as a mask file from the coverage tool.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>selections_is_obs_seq</TD>
    <TD>logical</TD>
    <TD>If .TRUE. the filename given for the "selections_file" is a full
obs_sequence file and not a text file from the coverage tool.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>latlon_tolerance</TD>
    <TD>real(r8)</TD>
    <TD>Specified in degrees. 
For observations to match in the
horizontal the difference in degrees for each of latitude and longitude
must be less than this threshold. If less than or equal to 0, the
values must match exactly.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>match_vertical</TD>
    <TD>logical</TD>
    <TD>If .TRUE. the locations of the observations in the input files have 
to match the selection list not only the horizontal but also in the vertical.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>surface_tolerance</TD>
    <TD>real(r8)</TD>
    <TD>Specified in meters. If "match_vertical" is .FALSE. this value is
ignored.  If "match_vertical" is .TRUE., this applies to observations with 
a vertical type of VERTISSURFACE.  For observations which match in the
horizontal, the vertical surface elevation difference must be less than 
this to be considered the same.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>pressure_tolerance</TD>
    <TD>real(r8)</TD>
    <TD>Specified in pascals. If "match_vertical" is .FALSE. this value is
ignored.  If "match_vertical" is .TRUE., this applies to observations with 
a vertical type of VERTISPRESSURE.  For observations which match in the
horizontal, the vertical difference must be less than this to be considered the same.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>height_tolerance</TD>
    <TD>real(r8)</TD>
    <TD>Specified in meters. If "match_vertical" is .FALSE. this value is
ignored.  If "match_vertical" is .TRUE., this applies to observations with 
a vertical type of VERTISHEIGHT.  For observations which match in the
horizontal, the vertical difference must be less than this to be considered the same.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>scaleheight_tolerance</TD>
    <TD>real(r8)</TD>
    <TD>Specified in unitless values. If "match_vertical" is .FALSE. this value is
ignored.  If "match_vertical" is .TRUE., this applies to observations with 
a vertical type of VERTISSCALEHEIGHT.  For observations which match in the
horizontal, the vertical difference must be less than this to be considered the same.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>level_tolerance</TD>
    <TD>real(r8)</TD>
    <TD>Specified in fractional model levels. If "match_vertical" is .FALSE. this value is
ignored.  If "match_vertical" is .TRUE., this applies to observations with 
a vertical type of VERTISLEVEL.  For observations which match in the
horizontal, the vertical difference must be less than this to be considered the same.
Note that some models only support integer level values, but others support
fractional levels.  The vertical value in an observation is a floating point/real
value, so fractional levels are possible to specify for an observation.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>print_only</TD>
    <TD>logical</TD>
    <TD>If .TRUE. do not create an output file, but print a summary of the
number and types of each observation in each input file, and then the number
of observations and types which would have been created in an output file.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>partial_write</TD>
    <TD>logical</TD>
    <TD>Generally only used for debugging problems.  After each input obs_seq
file is processed, this flag, if .TRUE., causes the code to write out the 
partial results to the output file.  The default is to process all input
files (if more than a single file is specified) and write the output file
only at the end of the processing.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>print_timestamps</TD>
    <TD>logical</TD>
    <TD>Generally only used for debugging very slow execution runs.
This flag, if .TRUE., causes the code to output timestamps (wall clock
time) at various locations during the processing phases.  It may help
isolate where particularly slow execution times are occurring.
For very large input files, or long lists of input files, it can also
help to estimate what the eventual run time of the job will be.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>calendar</TD>
    <TD>character(len=32)</TD>
    <TD>Set to the name of the calendar; only controls the
printed output for the dates of the first and last observations in the file.
Set this to "no_calendar" if the observations are not using any calendar.
</TD></TR>

<H2>BUILDING</H2>

<P>
Most <em class=file>$DART/models/*/work</em> directories contain files
needed to build this tool along with the other executable programs.  
It is also possible to build this tool in the 
<em class=file>$DART/observations/utilities</em> directory.
In either case the
<em class=file>preprocess</em> program must be built and run first to define
what set of observation types will be supported.  See the
<a href="../../../assimilation_code/programs/preprocess/preprocess.html">preprocess documentation</a>
for more details on how to define the list and run it.
The <em class=code>&amp;preprocess_nml</em>
namelist in the <em class=file>input.nml</em> file must contain files with
definitions for the combined set of all observation types which 
will be encountered over all input obs_seq files.
The other important choice when building the tool is to include a
compatible locations module in the <em class=file>path_names_obs_selection</em> file.  
For the low-order models the <em class=file>oned</em> module should be used; 
for real-world observations the <em class=file>threed_sphere</em> module should be used.
</P>
<P>Usually the directories where executables are built will include
a <em class=file>quickbuild.csh</em> script which builds and runs preprocess 
and then builds the rest of the executables by executing all files
with names starting with <em class=file>mkmf_</em>.
If the obs_selection tool is not built because there is no <em class=file>mkmf_obs_selection</em>
and <em class=file>path_names_obs_selection</em> file in the current directory they can be
copied from another model.  The <em class=file>path_names_obs_selection</em> file
will need to be edited to be consistent with the model you are building.
