<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>
   Main program for evaluating filter performance in observation space.
   Primarily, the prior or posterior ensemble mean (and spread) are compared
   to the observation and several quantities are calculated. These quantities
   are then saved in a netCDF file that has all the metadata to create
   meaningful figures.
</P>
<P>
   Each <em class="file">obs_seq.final</em> file contains an observation
   sequence that has multiple 'copies' of the observation. One copy is
   the actual observation, another copy is the prior ensemble mean estimate
   of the observation, one is the spread of the prior ensemble estimate,
   one may be the prior estimate from ensemble member 1, ... etc.
   If the original observation sequence
   is the result of a 'perfect model' experiment, there is an additional
   copy called the 'truth' - the noise-free expected observation given
   the true model state. Since this copy does not, in general, exist for
   the high-order models, all comparisons are made with the copy labelled
   'observation'. There is also a namelist variable
   (<em class=code>use_zero_error_obs</em>) to compare
   against the 'truth' instead; the observation error variance is then
   automatically set to zero.
</P>
<P>
   Each ensemble member applies a forward observation operator to the state to compute
   the "expected" value of an observation.  Please note:
   the forward observation operator is applied <strong>AFTER</strong> any prior inflation
   has taken place! Similarly, the forward observation operator is applied AFTER any posterior
   inflation. This has always been the case. For a detailed
   look at the relationship between the observation operators and inflation, please look at the
   <a href="../../filter/filter.html#DetailedProgramFlow">Detailed&nbsp;Program&nbsp;Execution Flow</a>
   section of <a href="../../filter/filter.html">filter.html</a>.<br /><br />
   Given multiple estimates of
   the observation, several quantities can be calculated. It is possible to
   compute the expected observations from the state vector before
   assimilating (the "guess", "forecast", or "prior") or after the
   assimilation (the "analysis", or "posterior").
</P>
<P>
   Even with <em class="file">input.nml</em>:<em class="code">filter_nml:num_output_obs_members</em>
   set to <em class="code">0</em>; the full [prior,posterior] ensemble mean and
   [prior,posterior] ensemble spread are preserved in the
   <em class="file">obs_seq.final</em> file. Consequently, the ensemble means and
   spreads are used to calculate the diagnostics.

   If the
   <em class="file">input.nml</em>:<em class="code">filter_nml:num_output_obs_members</em>
   is set to <em class="code">80</em> (for example); the first 80 ensemble members
   prior and posterior "expected" values of the observation are also included.
   In this case, the <em class="file">obs_seq.final</em> file contains enough
   information to calculate a rank histograms, verify forecasts, etc.
   The ensemble means are still used for many other calculations.
</P>

<P>
   Since this program is fundamentally interested in the response as a function of
   region, there are three versions of this program; one for each of the
   <em class=file>oned, threed_sphere, or threed_cartesian</em> location modules
   (<em class=file>location_mod.f90</em>). It did not make sense to ask the
   <em class=program>lorenz_96</em> model what part of North America you'd like
   to investigate or how you would like to bin in the vertical.
   The low-order models write out similar
   netCDF files and the Matlab scripts have been updated accordingly.
   The oned observations have locations conceptualized as being on
   a unit circle, so only the namelist input variables pertaining to longitude are
   used.
</P>
<P>
   Identity observations (only possible from "perfect model experiments")
   are already explored with state-space diagnostics,
   so <em class=program>obs_diag</em> simply skips them.
</P>
<P>
   <em class="program">obs_diag</em> is designed to explore the effect of
   the assimilation in three ways; 1) as a function of time for a particular
   variable and level (this is the figure on the left), 2) as a
   time-averaged vertical profile (figure in the middle), and sometimes
   3) in terms of a rank histogram - "Where does the actual observation rank
   relative to the  rest of the ensemble?" (figures on the right).
   The figures on the left and center were created by several Matlab&#174;
   scripts that query the <em class="file">obs_diag_output.nc</em> file:
   <em class="file">DART/diagnostics/matlab/<a href="../../../../diagnostics/matlab/plot_evolution.m">plot_evolution.m</a></em>
   and <a href="../../../../diagnostics/matlab/plot_profile.m">plot_profile.m</a>.
   Both of these takes as input a
   file name and a 'quantity' to plot ('rmse','spread','totalspread',&nbsp;...)
   and exhaustively plots the quantity (for every variable, every level,
   every region) in a single matlab figure window  - and creates a series
   of .ps files with multiple pages for each of the figures.
   The directory gets cluttered with them.
   The rank histogram information can easily be plotted with
   <a href="http://meteora.ucsd.edu/~pierce/ncview_home_page.html">ncview</a>,
   a free third-party piece of software or with
   <a href="../../../../diagnostics/matlab/plot_rank_histogram.m">plot_rank_histogram.m</a>.
</P>
<P>
   <em class="program">obs_diag</em> can be configured to compare the
   ensemble estimates against the 'observation' copy or the 'truth' copy based
   on the setting of the <em class=code>use_zero_error_obs</em> namelist variable.
</P>
<P>
   The observation sequence files contain only the time of the observation,
   nothing of the assimilation interval, etc. - so it requires user guidance
   to declare what sort of temporal binning for the temporal evolution
   plots. I do a 'bunch' of arithmetic on the namelist times to convert
   them to a series of temporal bin edges that are used when traversing
   the observation sequence. The actual algorithm is that the user input for
   the start date and bin width set up a sequence that ends in one of two ways ...
   the last time is reached or the number of bins has been reached.
</P>
<P>
   <em class=program>obs_diag</em> reads <em class=file>obs_seq.final</em>
   files and calculates the following quantities (in no particular order)
   for an arbitrary number of regions and levels.
   <em class=program>obs_diag</em> creates a netCDF file called
   <em class=file>obs_diag_output.nc</em>.  It is necessary to query
   the <em class=code>CopyMetaData</em> variable to determine the storage order
   (i.e. "which copy is what?") if you want to use your own plotting routines.

<P>
   The temporal evolution of the above quantities for every observation
   type (RADIOSONDE_U_WIND_COMPONENT, AIRCRAFT_SPECIFIC_HUMIDITY, ...) is
   recorded in the output netCDF file -
   <em class="file"><b>obs_diag_output.nc</b></em>.
   This netCDF file can then be loaded and displayed using the
   Matlab&#174; scripts in
   <em class=file>..../DART/diagnostics/matlab</em>.
   (which may depend on functions in <em class=file>..../DART/matlab</em>).
   The temporal, geographic, and vertical binning are under namelist
   control.
   Temporal averages of the above quantities are also stored in the netCDF
   file. Normally, it is useful to skip the 'burn-in' period - the amount
   of time to skip is under namelist control.
</P>

<P>
   The DART QC flag is intended to provide information about whether the
   observation was assimilated, evaluated only, whether the assimilation resulted
   in a 'good' observation, etc.
   <em class=green>DART QC values lower than <strong>2</strong> indicate the prior and posteriors are OK.</em>
   DART QC values higher than <strong>3</strong> were <strong>not</strong> assimilated or evaluated.

<H2>What is new in the Manhattan Release.</H2>
<ol>
    <li>Support for DART QC = 8 (failed vertical conversion).</li><br />
    <li>Simplified input file specification.</li><br />
    <li>Removed <em class=code>rat_cri</em> and
        <em class=code>input_qc_threshold</em> from the namelists. They had been
        deprecated for quite some time.</li><br />
    <li>Some of the internal variable names have been changed to make it 
        easier to distinguish between variances and standard deviations.</li>
</ol>

<H2>What is new in the Lanai Release.</H2>
<P>
   <em class=program>obs_diag</em> has several improvements:
</P>
<ol><li>Improved vertical specification. Namelist variables
        <em class=code>[h,p,m]level_edges</em> allow fine-grained control
        over the vertical binning. It is not allowed to specify both the
        edges and midpoints for the vertical bins.
        </li><br />
    <li>Improved error-checking for input specification, particularly
        the vertical bins. Repeated values are squeezed out.
        </li><br />
    <li>Support for 'trusted' observations. Trusted observation types may
        be specified in the namelist and all observations of that type will
        be counted in the statistics despite the DART QC code (as long as the
        forward observation operator succeeds).
        See namelist variable <em class=code>trusted_obs</em>.
        For more details, see the section on <A href="#Trusted">Trusted observations</A>.
        </li><br />
    <li>Support for 'true' observations (i.e. from an OSSE). If the
        'truth' copy of an observation is desired for comparison (instead of
        the default copy) the observation error variance is set to 0.0
        and the statistics are calculated relative to the 'truth' copy
        (as opposed to the normal 'noisy' or 'observation' copy).
        See namelist variable <em class=code>use_zero_error_obs</em>.
        </li><br />
    <li>discontinued the use of <em class=code>rat_cri</em> and
        <em class=code>input_qc_threshold</em> namelist variables.
        Their functionality was replaced by the DART QC mechanism long ago.
        </li><br />
     <li>The creation of the rank histogram (if possible) is now
        namelist-controlled by
        namelist variable <em class=code>create_rank_histogram</em>.

</P>

<H3 class=indent1>Discussion of obs_diag_output.nc</H3>

<P>
Every observation type encountered in the observation sequence file is
tracked separately, and aggregated into temporal and 3D spatial bins.
There are two main efforts to this program. One is to track the temporal
evolution of any of the quantities available in the netCDF file for any
possible observation type:
</P>
<div class="unix">ncdump -v CopyMetaData,ObservationTypes obs_diag_output.nc</div>
<P>
The other is to explore the vertical profile of a particular observation
kind. By default, each observation kind has a 'guess/prior' value and
an 'analysis/posterior' value - which shed some insight into the
innovations.
</P>

<P></P><hr width=40% align=left>

<H4 class=indent1>temporal evolution</H4>

<P>
The <em class="file">obs_diag_output.nc</em> output file has all the
metadata I could think of, as well as separate variables for every
observation type in the observation sequence file. Furthermore, there
is a separate variable for the 'guess/prior' and 'analysis/posterior'
estimate of the observation. To distinguish between the two, a suffix
is appended to the variable name.  An example seems appropriate:
</P>

Believe it or not, there are another set of netCDF variables specifically

distinguished by the suffix added to the observation kind - 'VPguess'
and 'VPanaly' - 'VP' for Vertical Profile.

<A NAME="Trusted"></A>
<H4 class=indent1>"Trusted" observation types</H4>
<P>
This needs to be stated up front: <em class=program>obs_diag</em> is a post-processor;
it cannot influence the assimilation. One interpretation of a TRUSTED observation is that
the assimilation should <strong>always</strong> use the observation, even if it is far from
the ensemble.  At present (23 Feb 2015), the filter in DART does not forcibly assimilate
any one observation and selectively assimilate the others.
Still, it is useful to explore the results using a set of 'trusted type' observations,
whether they were assimilated, evaluated, or rejected by the outlier threshhold.
This is the important distinction.
The diagnostics can be calculated differently for each <em>observation type</em>.
</P><P>
The normal diagnostics calculate the metrics
(rmse, bias, etc.) only for the 'good' observations - those that were assimilated or evaluated.
The <em class=code>outlier_threshold</em> essentially defines what observations are
considered too far from the ensemble <strong>prior</strong> to be useful. These
observations get a DART QC of 7 and are not assimilated. The observations with a
DART QC of 7 do not contribute the the metrics being calculated. Similarly, if the
forward observation operator fails, these observations cannot contribute. When the
operator fails, the 'expected' observation value is 'MISSING', and there is no
ensemble mean or spread.
</P><P>
'Trusted type' observation metrics are calculated using all the observations that
were assimilated or evaluated <strong>AND</strong> the observations that were rejected
by the outlier threshhold.  <em class=program>obs_diag</em> can post-process
the DART QC and calculate the metrics appropriately for <strong>observation types</strong>
listed in the <em class=code>trusted_obs</em> namelist variable. If there are trusted
observation types specified for <em class=program>obs_diag</em>, the
<em class=file>obs_diag_output.nc</em> has
global metadata to indicate that a different set of criteria were used to calculate
the metrics. The individual variables also have an extra attribute.
In the following output, <em class=file>input.nml:obs_diag_nml:trusted_obs</em>
was set:

<td width=45%>The Matlab scripts try to ensure that the trusted observation
        graphics clarify that the metrics plotted are somehow 'different' than
        the normal processing stream. Some text is added to indicate that the values
        include the outlying observations. <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The interpretation
        of the number of observations 'possible' and 'used' still reflects what was
        used <strong>in the assimilation!</strong> The number of observations rejected
        by the outlier threshhold is not explicilty plotted. To reinforce this, the
        text for the observation axis on all graphics has been changed to
        <em class=mono>"o=possible,&nbsp;*=assimilated"</em>. In short, the distance
        between the number of observations possible and the number assimilated still
        reflects the number of observations rejected by the outlier threshhold and the
        number of failed forward observation operators.

<P>There is ONE ambiguous case for trusted observations. There may be instances in
which the observation fails the outlier threshhold test (which is based on the prior)
and the posterior forward operator fails.
DART does not have a QC that explicilty covers this case. The current logic in
<em class=program>obs_diag</em> correctly handles these cases <strong>except</strong>
when trying to use 'trusted' observations. There is a section of code in
<em class=program>obs_diag</em> that may be enabled if you are encountering this
ambiguous case. As <em class=program>obs_diag</em> runs, a warning message is
issued and a summary count is printed if the ambiguous case is encountered.
What normally happens is that if that specific observation type is trusted,
the posterior values include a MISSING value in the calculation which makes
them inaccurate. If the block of code is enabled, the DART QC is recast as the
PRIOR forward observation operator fails. This is technically incorrect, but for
the case of trusted observations, it results in only calculating statistics for
trusted observations that have a useful prior and posterior. <strong>This should
not be used unless you are willing to intentionally disregard 'trusted' observations
that were rejected by the outlier threshhold.</strong> Since the whole point of a
trusted observation is to <em>include</em> observations potentially rejected by
the outlier threshhold, you see the problem.
Some people like to compare the posteriors. <em>THAT</em> can be the problem.

Discussion: It should be pretty clear that there is exactly 1 assimilation period,
it may surprise you that the start is 1 second past 12Z. This is deliberate and reflects
the DART convention of starting intervals 1 second after the end of the previous interval.
The times in the netCDF variables reflect the defined start/stop of the period, regardless
of the time of the first/last observation.
<br />
<br />
Please note that none of the 'horizontal_wind' variables will have a rank histogram,
so they are not written to the netCDF file. ANY variable that does not have a rank
histogram with some observations will NOT have a rank histogram variable
in the netCDF file.
<br />
<br />
Now that you have the <em class=file>obs_diag_output.nc</em>, you can explore it with
<a href="http://www.image.ucar.edu/DAReS/DART/DART2_Documentation.php#mat_obs">
plot_profile.m, plot_bias_xxx_profile.m, or plot_rmse_xxx_profile.m</a>,
and look at the rank histograms with
<a href="http://meteora.ucsd.edu/~pierce/ncview_home_page.html">ncview</a> or
<em class="program">plot_rank_histogram.m</em>.

<P>
The RMSE of the vector wind velocity is being used.
The bias is actually the bias of the wind speed, with no regard to
direction. Seems like this is not consistent ...
<br />
<br />
Use log(p) instead of pressure for binning/plotting.
<br />
<br />
Hope to have a separate DART QC flag for observations outside the model state.
Right now, all observations that have a DARt forward operator fail (extrapolate, mainly)
get counted as observations that are rejected. Logically, these observations
are not possible because most (all?) DART observation operators cannot extrapolate.
<br />
<br />
If the specified levels are not in the proper range for the observations, no vertical profile is built.
The 'verbose' option should highlight the fact there are no observations in the specified vertical bins -
AND provide some sort of guidance about the min and max values of the vertical values.
