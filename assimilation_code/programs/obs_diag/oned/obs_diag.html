<h2>Overview/Usage</h2>
<p>Main program for observation-space diagnostics for the models
with 1D locations. 18 quantities are calculated for each region for
each temporal bin specified by user input. The result of the code
is a netCDF file that contains the 18 quantities of the prior (aka
'guess') and posterior (aka 'analysis') estimates as a function of
time and region as well as all the metadata to create meaningful
figures. <strong>The 1D version of <em class=
"program">obs_diag</em> has defaults that automatically set the
first and last bin center based on the first and last observation
time in the set of observations being processed.</strong> This is
different behavior than the 3D versions.</p>
<p>Each <em class="file">obs_seq.final</em> file contains an
observation sequence that has multiple 'copies' of the observation.
One copy is the actual observation, another copy is the prior
ensemble mean estimate of the observation, one is the spread of the
prior ensemble estimate, one may be the prior estimate from
ensemble member 1, ... etc. The only observations for the 1D models
are generally the result of a 'perfect model' experiment, so there
is an additional copy called the 'truth' - the noise-free expected
observation given the true model state. Since this copy does not,
in general, exist for the high-order models, all comparisons are
made with the copy labelled 'observation'. There is also a namelist
variable (<em class="code">use_zero_error_obs</em>) to compare
against the 'truth' instead; the observation error variance is then
automatically set to zero.</p>
<p>Each ensemble member applies a forward observation operator to
the state to compute the "expected" value of an observation. Please
note: the forward observation operator is applied
<strong>AFTER</strong> any prior inflation has taken place!
Similarly, the forward observation operator is applied AFTER any
posterior inflation. This has always been the case. For a detailed
look at the relationship between the observation operators and
inflation, please look at the <a href=
"../../filter/filter.html#DetailedProgramFlow">Detailed Program Execution
Flow</a> section of <a href=
"../../filter/filter.html">filter.html</a>.<br>
<br>
Given multiple estimates of the observation, several quantities can
be calculated. It is possible to compute the expected observations
from the state vector before assimilating (the "guess", "forecast",
or "prior") or after the assimilation (the "analysis", or
"posterior").</p>
<p>Even with <em class="file">input.nml</em>:<em class=
"code">filter_nml:num_output_obs_members</em> set to <em class=
"code">0</em>; the full [prior,posterior] ensemble mean and
[prior,posterior] ensemble spread are preserved in the <em class=
"file">obs_seq.final</em> file. Consequently, the ensemble means
and spreads are used to calculate the diagnostics. If the
<em class="file">input.nml</em>:<em class=
"code">filter_nml:num_output_obs_members</em> is set to <em class=
"code">80</em> (for example); the first 80 ensemble members prior
and posterior "expected" values of the observation are also
included. In this case, the <em class="file">obs_seq.final</em>
file contains enough information to calculate a rank histograms,
verify forecasts, etc. The ensemble means are still used for many
other calculations.</p>

<p>Since this program is fundamentally interested in the response
as a function of region, there are three versions of this program;
one for each of the <em class="file">oned, threed_sphere, or
threed_cartesian</em> location modules (<em class=
"file">location_mod.f90</em>). It did not make sense to ask the
<em class="program">lorenz_96</em> model what part of North America
you'd like to investigate or how you would like to bin in the
vertical. The low-order models write out similar netCDF files and
the Matlab scripts have been updated accordingly. The oned
observations have locations conceptualized as being on a unit
circle, so only the namelist input variables pertaining to
longitude are used.</p>
<p><em class="program">obs_diag</em> is designed to explore the
effect of the assimilation in two ways; 1) as a function of time
for a particular variable (this is the figure on the left), and
sometimes 2) in terms of a rank histogram - "Where does the actual
observation rank relative to the rest of the ensemble?" (figure on
the right). The figures were created by MatlabÂ® scripts that query
the <em class="file">obs_diag_output.nc</em> file: <em class=
"file">DART/diagnostics/matlab/<a href=
"../../../../diagnostics/matlab/plot_evolution.m">plot_evolution.m</a></em>
and <a href=
"../../../../diagnostics/matlab/plot_rank_histogram.m">plot_rank_histogram.m</a>.
Both of these takes as input a file name and a 'quantity' to plot
('rmse','spread','totalspread', ...) and exhaustively plots
the quantity (for every variable, every region) in a single matlab
figure window - and creates a series of .ps files with multiple
pages for each of the figures. The directory gets cluttered with
them.</p>
<p>The observation sequence files contain only the time of the
observation, nothing of the assimilation interval, etc. - so it
requires user guidance to declare what sort of temporal binning for
the temporal evolution plots. I do a 'bunch' of arithmetic on the
namelist times to convert them to a series of temporal bin edges
that are used when traversing the observation sequence. The actual
algorithm is that the user input for the start date and bin width
set up a sequence that ends in one of two ways ... the last time is
reached or the number of bins has been reached.
<strong>NOTE:</strong> for the purpose of interpretability, the 1D
<em class="program">obs_diag</em> routines saves 'dates' as
GREGORIAN dates despite the fact these systems have no concept of a
calendar.</p>
<p><em class="program">obs_diag</em> reads <em class=
"file">obs_seq.final</em> files and calculates the following
quantities (in no particular order) for an arbitrary number of
regions and levels. <em class="program">obs_diag</em> creates a
netCDF file called <em class="file">obs_diag_output.nc</em>. It is
necessary to query the <em class="code">CopyMetaData</em> variable
to determine the storage order (i.e. "which copy is what?") if you
want to use your own plotting routines.</p>

<h2>What is new in the Manhattan Release.</h2>
<ol>
<li>Support for DART QC = 8 (failed vertical conversion). This is
provided simply to make the netCDF files as consistent as needed
for plotting purposes.<br></li>
<li>Simplified input file specification.<br></li>
<li>Some of the internal variable names have been changed to make
it easier to distinguish between variances and standard
deviations.</li>
</ol>
<h2>What is new in the Lanai Release.</h2>
<p><em class="program">obs_diag</em> has several improvements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Support for 'trusted' observations. Trusted observation types
may be specified in the namelist and all observations of that type
will be counted in the statistics despite the DART QC code (as long
as the forward observation operator succeeds). See namelist
variable <em class="code">trusted_obs</em>.<br></li>
<li>Support for 'true' observations (i.e. from an OSSE). If the
'truth' copy of an observation is desired for comparison (instead
of the default copy) the observation error variance is set to 0.0
and the statistics are calculated relative to the 'truth' copy (as
opposed to the normal 'noisy' or 'observation' copy). See namelist
variable <em class="code">use_zero_error_obs</em>.<br></li>
<li>discontinued the use of <em class="code">rat_cri</em> and
<em class="code">input_qc_threshold</em> namelist variables. Their
functionality was replaced by the DART QC mechanism long
ago.<br></li>
<li>The creation of the rank histogram (if possible) is now
namelist-controlled by namelist variable <em class=
"code">create_rank_histogram</em>.</li>

<br>
<br>
<p>The allowable ranges for the region boundaries are: lon [0.0,
1.0). The 1D locations are conceived as the distance around a unit
sphere. An observation with a location exactly ON a region boundary
cannot 'count' for both regions. The logic used to resolve this
is:</p>
<blockquote>if((lon â¥ lon1) .and. (lon &lt; lon2)) keeper =
.true.</blockquote>
<p>Consequently, if you want to include an observation precisely AT
1.0, (for example), you need to specify something a little larger
than 1.0.<br>
<br>
You can only specify <strong>either</strong> <em class=
"code">obs_sequence_name</em> <strong>or</strong> <em class=

empty string ... i.e. <em class="code">''</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li><em class="file">input.nml</em> is used for <em class=

<li><em class="file">obs_diag_output.nc</em> is the netCDF output

<li><em class="file">LargeInnov.txt</em> contains the distance

</ul>
<h3 class="indent1">Discussion of obs_diag_output.nc</h3>
<p>Every observation type encountered in the observation sequence
file is tracked separately, and aggregated into temporal and
spatial bins. There are two main efforts to this program. One is to
track the temporal evolution of any of the quantities available in
the netCDF file for any possible observation type:</p>
<div class="unix">ncdump -v CopyMetaData,ObservationTypes
obs_diag_output.nc</div>
<p>The other is to explore the vertical profile of a particular
observation kind. By default, each observation kind has a
'guess/prior' value and an 'analysis/posterior' value - which shed
some insight into the innovations.</p>
<hr width="40%" align="left">
<h4 class="indent1">temporal evolution</h4>
<p>The <em class="file">obs_diag_output.nc</em> output file has all
the metadata I could think of, as well as separate variables for
every observation type in the observation sequence file.
Furthermore, there is a separate variable for the 'guess/prior' and
'analysis/posterior' estimate of the observation. To distinguish
between the two, a suffix is appended to the variable name. An
example seems appropriate:</p>
<pre>
  ...
  char CopyMetaData(copy, stringlength) ;
          CopyMetaData:long_name = "quantity names" ;
  ...
  int rank_bins(rank_bins) ;
          rank_bins:long_name = "rank histogram bins" ;
          rank_bins:comment = "position of the observation among the sorted noisy ensemble members" ;
  float RAW_STATE_VARIABLE_guess(time, copy, region) ;
          RAW_STATE_VARIABLE_guess:_FillValue = -888888.f ;
          RAW_STATE_VARIABLE_guess:missing_value = -888888.f ;
  float RAW_STATE_VARIABLE_analy(time, copy, region) ;
          RAW_STATE_VARIABLE_analy:_FillValue = -888888.f ;
          RAW_STATE_VARIABLE_analy:missing_value = -888888.f ;
  ...
</pre>
<h4 class="indent1">rank histograms</h4>
<p>If it is possible to calculate a rank histogram, there will also
be :</p>
<pre>
   ...
  int RAW_STATE_VARIABLE_guess_RankHist(time, rank_bins, region) ;
   ...
</pre>
<p>as well as some global attributes. The attributes reflect the
namelist settings and can be used by plotting routines to provide
additional annotation for the histogram.</p>
<pre>
                :DART_QCs_in_histogram = 0, 1, 2, 3, 7 ;
                :outliers_in_histogram = "TRUE" ;
</pre>
<p>Please note:<br>
netCDF restricts variable names to 40 characters, so '_Rank_Hist'
may be truncated.</p>
