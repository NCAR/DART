<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>
<em class=program>obs_seq_coverage</em> queries a set of observation 
sequence files to determine which observation locations report 
frequently enough to be useful for a verification study. The big picture
is to be able to pare down a large set of observations into a compact
observation sequence file to run through <a href="../filter/filter.html">filter</a>
with all of the intended observation types flagged as 
<em class=option>evaluate_only</em>. DART's forward operators then
get applied and all the forecasts are preserved in a 
standard <em class=file>obs_seq.final</em> file - perhaps more 
appropriately called <em class=file>obs_seq.forecast</em>!
Paring down the input observation sequence file cuts down on the unnecessary
application of the forward operator to create observation copies that will
not be used anyway ... 
</P>

<img src="../../../docs/images/forecasting_diagram.png" alt="forecast evaluation schematic" width=90% />

<P>
<em class=program>obs_seq_coverage</em> results in two output files:
</P>
<ul>
<li><em class=file>obsdef_mask.txt</em> contains the list of observation definitions
(but not the observations themselves) that are desired. The observation definitions
include the locations and times for each of the desired observation types. This file
is read by <a href="../../../assimilation_code/programs/obs_selection/obs_selection.html">obs_selection</a> and combined with the raw
observation sequence files to create the observation sequence file appropriate for 
use in a forecast.
<br />
</li>
<li><em class=file>obsdef_mask.nc</em> contains information needed to be able
to plot the times and locations of the observations in a manner to help explore 
the design of the verification locations/network. 
<em class=file>obsdef_mask.nc</em> is <em class=strong>required</em> by
<a href="../../../assimilation_code/programs/obs_seq_verify/obs_seq_verify.html">obs_seq_verify</a>, the program
that reorders the observations into a structure that  
makes it easy to calculate statistics like ROC, etc.</li>
</ul>

<P>
The following section explains the strategy and requirements for determining
what observations will be used to verify a forecast. Since it is 'standard practice'
to make several forecasts to build statistical strength, it is important
to use the SAME set of observation locations for all the forecasts that will
be verified together. To make the discussion easier, let's define the
<em class=option>verification network</em> as the set of locations and times
for a particular observation type. 
<br />
<br />
The entire discussion about finding locations that are repeatedly observed
through time boils down to the simple statement that if the observation is within
about 500cm of a previous observation, they are treated as co-located observations.
For some very high resolution applications, this may be insufficient, but there it is.
For observations at pressure levels, see the <a href="#Usage">Word about vertical levels</a>.
<br />
<br />
The only complicated part of determining the verification network is the
temporal component. The initial time (usually an <em class=option>analysis time</em> 
from a previous assimilation), the 
<em class=option>verification interval</em>, and the 
<em class=option>forecast length</em> 
completely specify the temporal aspect of a forecast. The following example
has a verification interval of 6 hours and a forecast length of 24 hours. We adopt the 
convention of also including the initial conditions (a "nowcast") in the 
"forecast", so there are 5 times of interest - which we will call 
<em class=option>verification times</em> and are represented by 
<img src="../../../docs/images/verification_time_icon.png" alt="verification icon" width=3% />.
The candidate observation sequence files are scanned to select all the
observations that are <strong>closest</strong> to the verification times.
The difference in time between the "nowcast" and the "forecast" is the
<em class=option>forecast lead</em>.
<br />
<br />
<img src="../../../docs/images/simple_forecast.png" alt="simple forecast" width=60% />
<br />
<br />
So - that is simple enough if there is only one forecast, but this is rarely
the case. Let's say we have a second forecast. Ideally, we'd like to verify
at exactly the same locations and forecast leads - otherwise we're not
really comparing the same things. If the second verification network happens
to be at locations that are easy to predict, we're comparing apples and oranges.
The <em class=italic>fair</em> way to proceed is to determine the verification
network that is the same for all forecasts. This generally results in a pretty 
small set of observations - a problem we will deal with later.
<br />
<br />
The diagram below illustrates the logic behind determining the list of
verification times for a pretty common scenario: a 24-hour forecast with a
forecast lead of 6 hours, repeated the next day. 
The <em class=option>first_analysis</em> is at VT1 - let's call it 00Z day 1.
We need to have observations available at: <br />
VT1 (00Z day1),
VT2 (06Z day1), 
VT3 (12Z day1), 
VT4 (18Z day1), and 
VT5 (24Z day1 / 00Z day2).
The <em class=option>last_analysis</em> starts at VT5 00Z day 2 and must verify at<br />
VT5 (00Z day2),
VT6 (06Z day2), 
VT7 (12Z day2), 
VT8 (18Z day2), and 
VT9 (24Z day2 / 00Z day3).
<br />
<br /><a name="coverage"></a>
<img src="../../../docs/images/obs_seq_coverage_diagram.png" alt="coverage timetable" width=100% />
<br />
<br />
Note that, if you wanted to, you could launch forecasts at VT2, VT3, and VT4 without
adding extra constraints on the verification network. 
<em class=program>obs_seq_coverage</em> simply provides these possible 
forecasts "for free", there is no assumption about <strong>needing</strong> them.
We will use the variable <em class=option>verification_times</em> to describe
the complete set of times for all possible forecasts. In our example above,
there are 5 possible forecasts, each forecast consisting of 5 verification 
times (the analysis time and the 4 forecast lead times). As such, there are
9 unique verification times. 
<br />
<br />
Note that no attempt is made at checking the QC value of the candidate
observations. One of the common problems is that the region definition
does not mesh particularly well with the model domain and the DART 
forward operator fails because it would have to extrapolate (which is not allowed).
Without checking the QC value, this can mean there are a lot of 'false positives';
observations that seemingly could be used to validate, but are actually
just outside the model domain. I'm working on that ....
<br />

<em class=program>obs_seq_coverage</em>.

<H2>USAGE</H2>

<P>
<em class=program>obs_seq_coverage</em> is built in 
.../DART/models/<em class=italic>your_model</em>/work, in the same way
as the other DART components.
<br />
<br />
There is no requirement on the reporting time/frequence of the 
candidate voxels.  Once the verification times have been defined, 
the observation <strong>closest in time</strong> to the verification 
time is selected, the others are ignored. Only observations within half
the verification interval are eligible to be considered "close".
<br />
<br />
<strong>A word about vertical levels.</strong>
If the desired observation type has UNDEFINED or SURFACE for the vertical coordinate system,
there is no concern about trying to match the vertical. If the desired observation types use
PRESSURE; the following 14 levels are used as the standard levels:  1000, 925, 850, 700, 500, 
400, 300, 250, 200, 150, 100, 70, 50, 10 (all hPa). <strong>No other vertical coordinate system
is supported.</strong>

<H3 class=indent1>Example: a single 48-hour forecast that is evaluated every 6 hours.</H3>
<p>
<img src="../../../docs/images/verification_48hrX6hr.png" alt="Example 1" width=75% />
<br />
<br />
In this example, we are generating an <em class=file>obsdef_mask.txt</em>
file for a single forecast. All the required input observation sequence 
filenames will be contained in a file referenced by the 
<em class=option>obs_sequence_list</em> variable. We'll also restrict 
the observations to a specific rectangular (in Lat/Lon) region at a particular level.
It is convenient to turn on the verbose option the first time
to get a feel for the logic. Here are the namelist settings if you want to
verify the METAR_U_10_METER_WIND and METAR_V_10_METER_WIND observations over the
entire globe every 6 hours for 2 days starting 18Z 8 Jun 2008:

The first step is to create a file containing the list of observation 
sequence files you want to use. This can be done with the unix 
command 'ls' with the -1 option (that's a number one) to put one 
file per line, particularly if the files are organized in a nice fashion.
If your observation sequence are organized like this:
</p>
<pre>
/Exp1/Dir20080101/obs_seq.final
/Exp1/Dir20080102/obs_seq.final
/Exp1/Dir20080103/obs_seq.final
...
/Exp1/Dir20081231/obs_seq.final
</pre>
<p>
then
</p>
<div class=unix>
ls -1 /Exp1/Dir*/obs_seq.final &gt; obs_file_list.txt
</div>
<p>
creates the desired file.
Then, simply run <em class=program>obs_seq_coverage</em> - 
you may want to save the run-time output to a file. 
It is convenient to turn on the verbose option the first time.
Here is a portion of the run-time output:

<p>
Note that the values of <em class=code>ASSIMILATE_THESE_OBS_TYPES</em> and
<em class=code>EVALUATE_THESE_OBS_TYPES</em> are completely irrelevant - 
since we're not actually doing an assimilation. 
The <strong>BIG</strong> difference between the two output files is 
that <em class=file>obsdef_mask.txt</em> contains the metadata 
for just the matching observations while <em class=file>obsdef_mask.nc</em> 
contains the metadata for all candidate locations as well as a lot of
information about the desired verification times. It is possible to explore
<em class=file>obsdef_mask.nc</em> to review the selection criteria to
include observations/"voxels" that do not perfectly match the original selection
criteria.
<br />
<br />
Now that you have the <em class=file>obsdef_mask.nc</em>, you can explore it with
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/old_docs/docs_4_1/netcdf/ncdump.html">ncdump</a>.

<P>
The first thing to note is that there are more voxels (512) than reported 
during the run-time output (442). Typically, there will be many more voxels
in the netCDF file than will meet the selection criteria - but this is just
an example. Some of the voxels in the netCDF file do not meet the selection
criteria - meaning they do not have observations at all 9 required times.
Furthermore, there are 512 locations for ALL of the desired observation types.
In keeping with the DART philosophy of scalar observations, each observation 
type gets a separate voxel. There are <strong>not</strong> 512 
METAR_U_10_METER_WIND observations and 512 METAR_V_10_METER_WIND observations.
There are N METAR_U_10_METER_WIND observations and M METAR_V_10_METER_WIND
observations where N+M = 512.  And only 442 of them have observations at all the
times required for the verification. Dump the <em class=option>obs_type</em> variable
to see what voxel has what observation type.
<br />
<br />
The <em class=option>voxel</em> variable is fundamentally a flag that
indicates if the station has all of the desired verification times. Combine
that information with the <em class=option>obs_type</em> and 
<em class=option>location</em> to determine where your verifications of
any particular observation type will take place.
<br />
<br />
Now that you have the <em class=file>obsdef_mask.txt</em>, you can run 
<a href="../../../assimilation_code/programs/obs_selection/obs_selection.html">obs_selection</a> to subset the observation sequence
files into one compact file to use in your ensemble forecast.

<H2>FUTURE PLANS</H2>
<P>
<em class=removed>Relax the restriction requiring 100.0% temporal coverage.</em><br />
Sensibly require that we only require against observations that DART can compute.
i.e. the prior forward operator must complete successfully - almost all cases
of the operator failing are extrapolation issues; the observation is outside
the domain.
<br />
<br />
Note that no attempt is made at checking the QC value of the candidate
observations. One of the common problems is that the region definition
does not mesh particularly well with the model domain and the DART 
forward operator fails because it would have to extrapolate (which is not allowed).
Without checking the QC value, this can mean there are a lot of 'false positives';
observations that seemingly could be used to validate, but are actually
just outside the model domain. I'm working on that ....
