program ``obs_sequence_tool``
=============================

Overview
--------

DART observation sequence files are stored in a proprietary format. This tool makes it easier to manipulate these files,
allowing the user to subset or combine one or more files into a single output file.

The tool has many options to select subsets of observations by time, type, data value, and location. The tool also
allows the contents of observations to be changed by subsetting and/or reordering the copies and qc entries. Files with
equivalent data but with different metadata labels (e.g. 'NCEP QC' vs. 'QC') can now be merged as well. The tool can be
run without creating an output file, only printing a summary of the counts of each observation type in the input files,
and it can be used to convert from binary to ASCII and back.

The actions of the ``obs_sequence_tool`` program are controlled by a Fortran namelist, read from a file named
``input.nml`` in the current directory. A detailed description of each namelist item is described in the namelist
section below.

The examples section of this document below has extensive examples of common usages for this tool. Below that are more
details about DART observation sequence files, the structure of individual observations, and general background
information.

Namelist
--------

This namelist is read from the file ``input.nml``. Namelists start with an ampersand '&' and terminate with a slash '/'.
Character strings that contain a '/' must be enclosed in quotes to prevent them from prematurely terminating the
namelist.

Examples
--------

Here are details on how to set up common cases using this tool:

-  Merge multiple files
-  Subset in Time
-  Subset by Observation Type
-  Subset by Location
-  Binary to ASCII and back
-  Merging files with incompatible Metadata
-  Altering the number of Copies or QC values
-  Printing only
-  Subset by Observation or QC Value
-  Precomputed Forward Operator Values

Merge multiple files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Either specify a list of input files for ``filename_seq``, like:

::

   &obs_sequence_tool_nml
      filename_seq       = 'obs_seq20071101',
                           'qscatL2B_2007_11_01a.out',
                           'obs_seq.gpsro_2007110106',
      filename_out       = 'obs_seq20071101.all',
      gregorian_cal      = .true.
   /

and all observations in each of the three input files will be merged in time order and output in a single observation
sequence file. Or from the command line create a file containing one filename per line, either with 'ls':

::

   ls obs_seq_in* > tlist

or with a text editor, or any other tool of your choice. Then,

::

   &obs_sequence_tool_nml
      filename_seq_list = 'tlist',
      filename_out       = 'obs_seq20071101.all',
      gregorian_cal      = .true.
   /

will open 'tlist' and read the filenames, one per line, and merge them together. The output file will be named
'obs_seq20071101.all'. Note that the filenames inside the list file should not have delimiters (e.g. single or double
quotes) around the filenames.

Subset in time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The observations copied to the output file can be restricted in time by setting the namelist items for the first and
last observation timestamps (in days and seconds). It is not an error for some of the input files to have no
observations in the requested time range, and multiple input files can have overlapping time ranges. For example:

::

   &obs_sequence_tool_nml
      filename_seq       = 'obs_seq20071101',
                           'qscatL2B_2007_11_01a.out',
                           'obs_seq.gpsro_2007110106',
      filename_out       = 'obs_seq20071101.06hrs',
      first_obs_days     = 148592,
      first_obs_seconds  =  10801,
      last_obs_days      = 148592,
      last_obs_seconds   =  32400,
      gregorian_cal      = .true.
   /

The time range is inclusive on both ends; observations with times equal to the boundary times will be copied to the
output. To split a single input file up into proper subsets (no replicated observations), the first time of the
following output sequence should be +1 second from the last time of the previous output sequence. If the goal is to
match an observation sequence file with an assimilation window during the execution of the ``filter`` program, the
windows should be centered around the assimilation time starting at minus 1/2 the window time plus 1 second, and ending
at exactly plus 1/2 the window time.

Subset by observation type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You specify a list of observation types, by string name, and then specify a logical value to say whether this is the
list of observations to keep, or if it's the list of observations to discard. For example,

::

   &obs_sequence_tool_nml
      filename_seq       = 'obs_seq20071101.06hrs',
      filename_out       = 'obs_seq20071101.wind',
      obs_types          = 'RADIOSONDE_U_WIND_COMPONENT',
                           'RADIOSONDE_V_WIND_COMPONENT',
      keep_types         = .true.,
      gregorian_cal      = .true.
   /

will create an output file which contains only the U and V wind observations from the given input file.

::

   &obs_sequence_tool_nml
      filename_seq       = 'obs_seq20071101.06hrs',
      filename_out       = 'obs_seq20071101.notemp',
      obs_types          = 'RADIOSONDE_TEMPERATURE',
      keep_types         = .false.,
      gregorian_cal      = .true.
   /

will strip out all the radiosonde temperature observations and leave everything else.

Subset by location
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the observations have locations specified in 3 dimensions, as latitude, longitude, and a vertical coordinate, then it
can be subset by specifying the corners of a lat, lon box. There is currently no vertical subsetting option. For
example:

::

      min_lat            =    0.0,
      max_lat            =   20.0,
      min_lon            =  230.0,
      max_lon            =  260.0,

will only output observations between 0 and 20 latitude and 230 to 260 in longitude. Latitude ranges are −90 to 90,
longitude can either be specified from −180 to +180, or 0 to 360.

If the observations have 1 dimensional locations, between 0 and 1, then a bounding box can be specified like:

::

      min_box = 0.2,
      max_box = 0.4,

will keep only those observations between 0.2 and 0.4. In all these tests, points on the boundaries are considered
inside the box.

Binary to ASCII and back
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To convert a (more compact) binary observation sequence file to a (human readable and portable) ASCII file, a single
input and single output file can be specified with no selection criteria. The output file format is specified by the
``write_binary_obs_sequence`` item in the ``&obs_sequence_nml`` namelist in the ``input.nml`` file. It is a Fortran
logical; setting it to ``.TRUE.`` will write a binary file, setting it to ``.FALSE.`` will write an ASCII text file. If
you have a binary file, it must be converted on the same kind of platform as it was created on before being moved to
another architecture. At this point in time, there are only 2 remaining incompatible platforms: IBM systems based on
PowerPC chips, and everything else (which is Intel or AMD).

Any number of input files and selection options can be specified, as well, but for a simple conversion, leave all other
input namelist items unset.

Merging files with incompatible metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To merge files which have the same number of copies and qc but different labels for what is exactly the same data, you
can specify a list of synonym strings that will pass the matching test. For example:

::

   &obs_sequence_tool_nml
      filename_seq       = 'qscatL2B_2007_11_01.out',
                           'obs_seq20071101',
                           'obs_seq.gpsro_2007110124',
      filename_out       = 'obs_seq20071101.all',
      gregorian_cal      = .true.
      synonymous_copy_list = 'NCEP BUFR observation', 'AIRS observation', 'observation',
      synonymous_qc_list   = 'NCEP QC index', 'AIRS QC', 'QC flag - wvc quality flag', 'QC',
   /

will allow any copy listed to match any other copy on that list, and same with the QC values. If the output metadata
strings are not specified (see below), then the actual metadata strings from the first file which is used will set the
output metadata strings.

To rename or override, with care, existing metadata strings in a file, set the appropriate edit strings to true, and set
the same number of copies and/or QC values as will be in the output file. Note that this will replace, without warning,
whatever is originally listed as metadata. You can really mangle things here, so use this with caution:

::

   &obs_sequence_tool_nml
      filename_seq       = 'qscat_all_qc_305.out', 'qscat_all_qc_306.out',
      filename_out       = 'qscat_1_qc_2007_11.out',
      edit_copy_metadata = .true.,
      new_copy_metadata  = 'observation', 
      edit_qc_metadata   = .true.,
      new_qc_metadata    = 'QC', 'DART quality control',
      gregorian_cal      = .true.
   /

The log file will print out what input strings are being replaced; check this carefully to be sure you are doing what
you expect.

If you use both a synonym list and the edit list, the output file will have the specified edit list strings for
metadata.

Altering the number of copies or QC values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete some of the copies or QC values in each observation, specify the copy or QC index numbers which are to be
passed through, and list them in the exact order they should appear in the output:

::

      edit_copies = .true.,
      new_copy_index = 1, 2, 81, 82,

      edit_qcs = .true.,
      new_qc_index = 2, 

This will create an output sequence file with only 4 copies; the original first and second copies, and copies 81 and 82.
The original metadata will be retained. It will have only the second QC value from the original file.

If you are editing the copies or QCs and also specifying new metadata strings, use the number and order appropriate to
the output file regardless of how many copies or QC values there were in the original input files.

You can use these index lists to reorder copies or QC values by specifying the same number of index values as currently
exist but list them in a different order. Index values can be repeated multiple times in a list. This will duplicate
both the metadata string as well as the data values for the copy or QC.

To delete all copies or QCs specify -1 as the first (only) entry in the new index list.

::

      edit_qcs = .true.,
      new_qc_index = -1, 

To add copies or QCs, use 0 as the index value.

::

      edit_copies = .true.,
      new_copy_index = 1, 2, 0, 81, 82, 0
      new_copy_data = 3.0, 8.0,

      edit_qcs = .true.,
      new_qc_index = 2, 1, 3, 0,
      new_qc_data = 1.0,

This will insert 2 new copies in each observation and give them values of 3.0 and 8.0 in all observations. There is no
way to insert a different value on a per-obs basis. This example will also reorder the 3 existing QC values and then add
1 new QC value of 1 in all observations. The 'edit_copy_metadata' and 'edit_qc_metadata' flags with the
'new_copy_metadata' and 'new_qc_metadata' lists can be used to set the metadata names of the new copies and QCs.

::

      edit_copies = .true.,
      new_copy_index = 1, 0, 2, 0,
      new_copy_data = 3.0, 8.0,
      edit_copy_metadata = .true.,
      new_copy_metadata = 'observation', 'new copy 1',
                          'truth',       'new copy 2',

      edit_qcs = .true.,
      new_qc_index = 0, 2,
      new_qc_data = 0.0,
      edit_qc_metadata = .true.,
      new_qc_metadata = 'dummy QC', 'DART QC',

To remove an existing QC value and add a QC value of 0 for all observations, run with:

::

      edit_qcs = .true.,
      new_qc_index = 0,
      new_qc_data = 0.0,
      edit_qc_metadata = .true.,
      new_qc_metadata = 'dummy QC',

to add a constant QC of 0 for all observations, with a metadata label of 'dummy QC'.

It would be useful to allow copies or QCs from one file to be combined, obs by obs, with those from another file.
However, it isn't easy to figure out how to ensure the observations in multiple files are in exactly the same order so
data from the same obs are being combined. Also how to specify what should be combined is a bit complicated. So this
functionality is NOT available in this tool.

Printing only
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that you can set all the other options and then set print true, and it will do all the work and then just print out
how many of each obs type would have been created. It is an easy way to preview what your choices would do without
waiting to write an output file. It only prints the type breakdown for output file, but does print a running total of
how many obs are being kept from each input file. For example:

::

   &obs_sequence_tool_nml
      filename_seq       = 'obs_seq20071101',
      print_only         =  .true.,
   /

Subset by observation or QC value
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can specify a min, max data value and/or min, max qc value, and only those within the range will be kept. There is
no exclude option. For the data value, you must also specify an observation type since different types have different
units and valid ranges. For example:

::

   # keep only observations with a DART QC of 0:

Precomputed Forward Operator Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Precomputed Forward Operator Values are the result of an external program
that computes the expected observation values from an ensemble of model states
and includes these values as part of the observation metadata (see, for example,
the ``GSI2DART`` observation converter).
By default, any observation with precomputed forward operator (FO) values 
will have those values simply pass through ``obs_sequence_tool``
just like any other piece of metadata.  If the precomputed forward operator
values for any or all observation types are not wanted, it is possible to 
remove the precomputed values and retain the rest of the observation. 

.. note ::

  observations resulting from
  ``perfect_model_obs`` are **not** 
  precomputed forward observation values!

.. code-block:: none

  # keep all precomputed values from all observations with precomputed values (the default):
     remove_precomputed_FO_values = ''
  
  # remove all precomputed values from all observations with precomputed values:
     remove_precomputed_FO_values = 'ALL'
  
  # remove all precomputed values for specific observation types (case does not matter):
  # The observations themselves will still be present in the output, given no other
  # subsetting processing.
     remove_precomputed_FO_values = 'RADIOSONDE_TEMPERATURE', 'AMDAR_U_WIND_COMPONENT' 


Discussion
----------

DART observation sequence files are lists of individual observations, each with a type, a time, one or more values
(called copies), zero or more quality control flags, a location, and an error estimate. Regardless of the physical order
of the observations in the file, they are always processed in increasing time order, using a simple linked list
mechanism. This tool reads in one or more input observation sequence files, and creates a single output observation
sequence file with all observations sorted into a single, monotonically increasing time ordered output file.

DART observation sequence files contain a header with the total observation count and a table of contents of observation
types. The output file from this tool culls out unused observations, and only includes observation types in the table of
contents which actually occur in the output file. The table of contents **does not** need to be the same across multiple
files to merge them. Each file has a self-contained numbering system for observation types. However, the
``obs_sequence_tool`` must be compiled with a list of observation types (defined in the ``obs_def`` files listed in the
``preprocess`` namelist) which includes all defined types across all input files. See the building section below for
more details on compiling the tool.

The tool can handle observation sequence files at any stage along the processing pipeline: a template file with
locations but no data, input files for an assimilation which have observation values only, or output files from an
assimilation which then might include the prior and posterior mean and standard deviation, and optionally the output
from the forward operator from each ensemble member. In all of these cases, the format of each individual observation is
the same. It has zero or more *copies*, which is where the observation value and the means, forward operators, etc are
stored. Each observation also has zero or more quality control values, *qc*, which can be associated with the incoming
data quality, or can be added by the DART software to indicate how the assimilation processed this observation. Each of
the copies and qc entries has an single associated character label at the start of the observation sequence file which
describes what each entry is, called the *metadata*.

For multiple observation sequence files to be merged they must have the same number of *copies* and *qc* values, and all
associated *metadata* must be identical. To merge multiple files where the numbers do not match exactly, the tool can be
used on the individual files to rename, subset, and reorder the *copies* and/or *qc* first, and then the resulting files
are mergeable. To merge multiple files where the metadata strings do not match, but the data copy or qc values are
indeed the same things, there are options to rename the metadata strings. **This option should be used with care. If the
copies or qc values in different files are not really the same, the tool will go ahead and merge them but the resulting
file will be very wrong.**

The tool offers an additional option for specifying a list of input files. The user creates an ASCII file by any desired
method (e.g. ls > file, editor), with one filename per line. The names on each line in the file should not have any
delimiters, e.g. no single or double quotes at the start or end of the filename. They specify this file with the
``filename_seq_list`` namelist item, and the tool opens the list file and processes each input file in turn. The
namelist item ``num_input_files`` is now DEPRECATED and is ignored. The number of input files is computed from either
the explicit list in ``filename_seq``, or the contents of the ``filename_seq_list`` file.

Time is stored inside of DART as a day number and number of seconds, which is the same no matter which calendar is being
used. But many real-world observations use the Gregorian calendar for converting between number of days and an actual
date. If the ``gregorian_cal`` namelist item is set to ``.TRUE.`` then any times will be printed out to the log file
will be both in day/seconds and calendar date. If the observation times are not using the Gregorian calendar, then set
this value to ``.FALSE.`` and only days/seconds will be printed.

The most common use of this tool is to process a set of input files into a single output file, or to take one input file
and extract a subset of observations into a smaller file. The examples section below outlines several common scenerios.

The tool now also allows the number of copies to be changed, but only to select subsets or reorder them. It is not yet
possible to merge copies or QCs from observations in different files into a single observation with more copies.

Observations can also be selected by a given range of quality control values or data values.

Observations can be restricted to a given bounding box, either in latitude and longitude (in the horizontal only), or if
the observations have 1D locations, then a single value for min_box and max_box can be specified to restrict the
observations to a subset of the space.

Faq
---

Can i merge files where the observation types are different?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes. The numbering in the table of contents at the top of each file is only local to that file. All processing of types
is done with the string name, not the numbers. Neither the set of obs types, nor the observation numbers need to match
across files.

I get an error about unknown observation types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Look at the ``&preprocess_nml`` namelist in the input.nml file in the directory where your tool was built. It must have
all the observation types you need to handle listed in the ``input_files`` item.

Can i list more files than necessary in my input file list?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sure. It will take slightly longer to run, in that the tool must open the file and check the times and observation
types. But it is not an error to list files where no observations will be copied to the output file. It is a common task
to list a set of observation files and then set the first and last observation times, run the tool to select a shorter
time period, then change the first and last times and run again with the same list of files.

Building
--------

Most ``$DART/models/*/work`` directories will build the tool along with other executable programs. It is also possible
to build the tool in the ``$DART/observations/utilities`` directory. The ``preprocess`` program must be built and run
first, to define what set of observation types will be supported. See the
:doc:`../../../assimilation_code/programs/preprocess/preprocess` for more details on how to define the list and run it.
The combined list of all observation types which will be encountered over all input files must be in the preprocess
input list. The other important choice when building the tool is to include a compatible locations module. For the
low-order models, the ``oned`` module should be used; for real-world observations, the ``threed_sphere`` module should
be used.
