#
# This script cleans up a DART work dir.  It removes all the executables
# built by the quickbuild.csh script, plus other files created by the
# quickbuild.csh script (e.g. Makefile, input.nml.*_default, etc),
# and any .nc files created from .cdl files.  It does *not* remove
# files created by running the executables (e.g. output .nc files,
# obs_seq.* files, etc) other than the dart_log.* files.
#
#
# Usage: 
#  If called with no arguments, it runs in the current directory.
#  If called with arguments, cd to each one in turn and run the script.
#
# Example usage to clean up entire dart checked out tree:
#
#  - put quickclean.csh somewhere on your search path or
#    add $DART/assimilation_code/scripts to your path.
#
#   > cd $DART
#   > find . -name work -exec quickclean.csh {} \;
#
