<H4>Text File to DART Converter</H4>

<P>
If you have observations in spreadsheet or column format, in text, 
with a single line per observation, then the files this directory
are a template for how to convert these observations
into a format suitable for DART use.
</P>
<P>
The workflow is usually: 
</P>
<ul>
<li>read in the needed information about each
observation - location, time, data value, observation type - from 
a data source (usually a file)</li>
<li>call a series of DART library routines to construct a derived type that
contains all the information about a single observation</li>
<li>call another set of DART library
routines to put it into a time-sorted series</li>
<li>repeat the last 2 steps until all observations are processed</li>
<li>finally, call a write subroutine that writes out the entire series to a file in 
a format that DART can read in</li>
</ul>
<P>
It is not recommended that you try to mimic the ascii file format
by other means; the format is subject to change and the library routines
will continue to be supported even if the physical format changes.
</P>
<P>
If your input data is in some kind of format like netCDF or HDF,
then one of the other converters (e.g. the MADIS ones for netCDF) might
be a better starting place for adapting code.
</P>

<HR />
<H2>DATA SOURCES</H2>

<P>
This part is up to you.  
For each observation you will need a location, a data value,
a type, a time, and some kind of error estimate.  The error 
estimate can be hardcoded in the converter if they are not 
available in the input data.  See below for more details on 
selecting an appropriate error value.
</P>

<!--==================================================================-->

<A NAME="Programs"></A>
<HR />
<H2>PROGRAMS</H2>
<P>
The <em class=file>text_to_obs.f90</em> file is the source
for the main converter program.
Look at the source code where it reads the example data file.  You will
almost certainly need to change the "read" statement to match your data
format.  The example code 
reads each text line into a character buffer
and then reads from that buffer to parse up the data items.
</P> <P>
To compile and test,
go into the work subdirectory and run the <em class=file>quickbuild.csh</em>
script to build the converter and a couple of general purpose utilities.
<em class=file>advance_time</em> helps with calendar and time computations,
and the
<em class=file>obs_sequence_tool</em> manipulates DART observation files
once they have been created.
</P>
<P>
To change the observation types, look in the 
<em class=file>DART/obs_def</em> directory.  If you can
find an obs_def_XXX_mod.f90 file with an appropriate set
of observation types, change the 'use' lines in the converter
source to include those types.  Then add that filename in the 
<em class=file>input.nml</em> namelist file
to the &amp;preprocess_nml namelist, the 'input_files' variable.
Multiple files can be listed.  Then run quickbuild.csh again.
It remakes the table of supported observation types before 
trying to recompile the source code.
</P>
<P>
An example script for converting batches of files is
in the <em class=file>shell_scripts</em> directory. A tiny example
data file is in the <em class=file>data</em> directory.
These are <em>NOT</em> intended to be turnkey scripts; they will
certainly need to be customized for your use.  There are comments
at the top of the script saying what options they include, and
should be commented enough to indicate where changes will be
likely to need to be made.

<H2>DECISIONS YOU MIGHT NEED TO MAKE</H2>

<P>
See the discussion in the
<a href="../README.md#Decisions">obs_converters/README.md</a> 
page about what options are available for the things you need to
specify.  These include setting a time, specifying an expected error,
setting a location, and an observation type.
