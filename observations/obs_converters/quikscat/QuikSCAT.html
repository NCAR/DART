<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>
NASA's QuikSCAT mission is described in 
<A href="http://winds.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/quikscat/index.cfm">
http://winds.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/quikscat/</A>.
"QuikSCAT" refers to the satellite, "SeaWinds" refers to the 
instrument that provides near-surface wind speeds and directions 
over large bodies of water. QuikSCAT has an orbit of about 100 minutes,
and the SeaWinds microwave radar covers a swath under the satellite.
The swath is comprised of successive scans (or rows) and each scan
has many wind-vector-cells (WVCs). For the purpose of this document,
we will focus only the <b>Level 2B</b> product at 25km resolution.
If you go to the official JPL data distribution site
<a href="http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/DATA_CATALOG/quikscatinfo.html"
>http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/DATA_CATALOG/quikscatinfo.html</a>
, we are using the product labelled <b>L2B OWV 25km Swath</b>.
Each orbit consists of (potentially) 76 WVCs in each of 1624 rows or
scans. The azimuthal diversity of the radar returns affects the
error characteristics of the retrieved wind speeds and directions,
as does rain, interference of land in the radar footprint, and very
low wind speeds.  Hence, not all wind retrievals are created equal.
</P>
<P>
The algorithm that converts the 'sigma naughts' (the measure of radar
backscatter) into wind speeds and directions has multiple solutions.
Each candidate solution is called an 'ambiguity', and there are several
ways of choosing 'the best' ambiguity. Beauty is in the eye of the
beholder. At present, the routine to convert the original L2B data files
(one per orbit) in HDF format into the DART observation sequence file
makes several assumptions:
</P>
<ol>
<li>All retrievals are labelled with a 10m height, in accordance with 
    the retrieval algorithm.</li>
<li>Only the highest-ranked (by the MLE method) solution is desired.</li>
<li>Only the WVCs with a wvc_quality_flag of <b>zero</b> are desired.</li>
<li>The mission specification of a wind speed rms error of 2 ms 
    (for winds less than 20 m/s) and 10% for windspeeds between 
    20 and 30 m/s can be extended to all winds with a qc flag of zero.</li>
<li>The mission specification of an error in direction of 20 degrees rms 
    is applicable to all retrieved directions.</li>
<li>All retrievals with wind speeds less than 1.0 are not used.</li>
<li>The above error characterstics can be simplified when deriving the 
    horizontal wind components (i.e. U,V). <b>Note :</b> this may or may
    not be a good assumption, and efforts to assimilate the speed and 
    direction directly are under way.</li>
</ol>

<A NAME="DataSources"></A>
<HR />
<H2>DATA SOURCES</H2>

<P>
The NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) 
<A href="http://winds.jpl.nasa.gov/imagesAnim/quikscat.cfm">
data repository</A> has a collection of animations and data
sets from this instrument. In keeping with NASA tradition,
these data are in HDF format (specifically, HDF4), so if you want
to read these files directly, you will need to install the HDF4
libraries (which can be downloaded from 
<a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/products/hdf4/"
>http://www.hdfgroup.org/products/hdf4/</a>)
</P>
<P>
If you go to the official JPL data distribution site
<a href="http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/DATA_CATALOG/quikscatinfo.html"
>http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/DATA_CATALOG/quikscatinfo.html</a>, 
we are using the product labelled <b>L2B OWV 25km Swath</b>. They are
organized in folders by day ... with each orbit (each revolution)
in one compressed file. There are 14 revolutions per day. 
The conversion to DART observation sequence format is done on each
revolution, multiple revolutions may be combined 'after the fact' by
any <em class="program">obs_sequence_tool</em> in the 
<em class="file">work</em> directory of any model.
</P>

<!--==================================================================-->

<A NAME="Programs"></A>
<HR />
<H2>PROGRAMS</H2>

<P>There are several programs that are distributed from the JPL www-site,
<a href="ftp://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/ocean_wind/quikscat/L2B/sw/"
>ftp://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/ocean_wind/quikscat/L2B/sw/</a>; 
we specifically started from the Fortran file 
<a
href="ftp://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/ocean_wind/quikscat/L2B/sw/FORTRAN/read_qscat2b.f">read_qscat2b.f</a>
and modified it to be called as a subroutine to make it more similar to
the rest of the DART framework. The original 
<em class="file">Makefile</em> and  
<em class="file">read_qscat2b.f</em> are included in the DART
distribution in the <em class="file">DART/observations/quikscat</em>
directory. You will have to modify the <em class="file">Makefile</em> 
to build the executable.  
</P>

<h3>convert_L2b.f90</h3>
<P>
<em class="program">convert_L2b</em> is the executable that reads the
HDF files distributed by JPL.  
<em class="file">DART/observations/quikscat/work</em> has the expected
<em class="file">mkmf_convert_L2b</em> and 
<em class="file">path_names_convert_L2b</em> files and compiles the 
executable in the typical DART fashion - with one exception.
The location of the HDF (and possible dependencies) installation must
be conveyed to the <em class="program">mkmf</em> build mechanism. Since
this information is not required by the rest of DART, it made sense
(to me) to isolate it in the <em class="file">mkmf_convert_L2b</em>
script. <b>It will be necessary to modify the <em
class="file">mkmf_convert_L2b</em> script to
be able to build <em class="program">convert_L2b</em></b>. In particular,
you will have to change the two lines specifying the location of the HDF 
(and probably the JPG) libraries. The rest of the script should require
little, if any, modification.
</P>

<div class="routine">
set JPGDIR = <em class="input">/contrib/jpeg-6b_gnu-4.1.2-64</em><br />
set HDFDIR = <em class="input">/contrib/hdf-4.2r4_gnu-4.1.2-64</em><br />
</div>

<P>
There are a lot of observations in every QuikSCAT orbit. Consequently,
the observation sequence files are pretty large - particularly if you
use the ASCII format. Using the binary format (i.e. 
<em class="input">obs_sequence_nml:write_binary_obs_sequence = .true.</em>)
will result in observation sequence files that are about <em>half</em>
the size of the ASCII format.
</P>
<P>
Since there are about 14 QuikSCAT orbits per day, it may be useful to
convert individual orbits to an observation sequence file and then
concatenate multiple observation sequence files into one file per day.
This may be trivially accomplished with the 
<em class="program">obs_sequence_tool</em> program in any <em
class="file">model/xxxx/work</em> directory. Be sure to include the
<em class="code">'../../../obs_def/obs_def_QuikSCAT_mod.f90'</em> string
in <em class="code">input.nml&amp;preprocess_nml:input_files</em> when you
run <em class="program">preprocess</em>.
</P>

<h3>obs_to_table.f90, plot_wind_vectors.m</h3>
<P>
<em class="file">DART/diagnostics/threed_sphere/obs_to_table.f90</em> is
a potentially useful tool. You can run the observation sequence files
through this filter to come up with a 'XYZ'-like file that can be readily
plotted with 
<em class="file">DART/diagnostics/matlab/plot_wind_vectors.m</em>.
</P>

<!--=================== DESCRIPTION OF A NAMELIST  ===================-->
<!--==================================================================-->

<A NAME="Namelist"></A>
<HR />
<H2>NAMELIST</H2>
<P>This namelist is read from the file <em class=file>input.nml</em>.
We adhere to the F90 standard of starting a namelist with an ampersand
'&amp;' and terminating with a slash '/' for all our namelist input.
Character strings that contain a '/' must be
enclosed in quotes to prevent them from prematurely terminating the namelist.
The following values are the defaults for these namelist items.
</P>
<div class=namelist>
<pre>
&amp;convert_L2b_nml
   l2b_file = '',
   datadir = '.',
   outputdir = '.',
   lon1 = 0.0, 
   lon2 = 360.0, 
   lat1 = -90.0, 
   lat2 = 90.0,
   along_track_thin = 0,
   cross_track_thin = 0
 /
</pre>
</div>

<br />

<div>

<P>
It is possible to restrict the output observation sequence to contain
data from a region of interest throught the use of the namelist
parameters. If you need a region that spans the Prime Meridian
lon1 can be a larger number than lon2,
for example, a region from 300 E to 40 E and 60 S to 30 S (some of 
the South Atlantic), would be <em class="input">lon1 = 300, lon2 =
40, lat1 = -60, lat2 = -30</em>.

<A NAME="FuturePlans"></A>
<HR />
<H2>FUTURE PLANS</H2>
<ol>
   <li>There is one bit of error-checking that did not survive the
       conversion from F77 to F90. I need to restore the check that the
       HDF file being read is a 'Level 2B' product.</li>
   <li>There is a lot of error-checking that is not being done. I need
       to bulletproof the code more.</li>
   <li>We need namelist options to select something other than the 
       highest-ranked ambiguity.</li>
   <li>We need namelist options to select more QC flags - not 
       just the ones with the 'perfect' QC value of 0</li>
   <li>Add an option to leave the observations as speed and direction
       instead of converting them to U,V components. This is a 
       natural implementation of the instrument error 
       characteristics. However, it would require writing a specialized 
       forward operator in order to assimilate obs of this type (speed,
       direction), and there is still a numerical problem with trying to 
       do the statistics required during the assimilation of a 
       cyclic direction value.</li>
