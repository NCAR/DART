All the programs in the prep_bufr directory read bufr format data files
and output ascii intermediate files. These ascii files then need to be 
  converted to obs_seq files by programs in the NCEP/ascii_to_obs dir.

For my own sanity here is the story on the scripts here:

multi_parallel.batch - new script that should be able to convert N days
  at a time.  requires advance_time in this directory, thus the new
  quickbuild.sh and mkmf files for the first time.

run_one_prepbufr.csh - wrapper script that makes a unique directory for
  each day and does the conversion there.  intended to be called by the
  parallel batch script.

prepbufr.csh - convert a single day of prepbufr files (4/day) at a time.
  uses advance_time and can output either a single output (daily) ascii
  file or 4 6-hour ascii files. 

run_some_prepbufr.csh - simple loop program that does up to a month of
  conversions at a time.  but does NOT run in parallel, in spite of
  appearances, on batch nodes with MPI.  use multi_parallel.batch instead.



building the executables:

unlike the rest of the system, this still uses a lot of the prep_bufr
distribution code.  you cd up one directory and run './install.sh' to
build the bufr lib and the executables needed.  they all end up in
the 'exe' subdir with an extension of .x

the quickbuild.sh script builds advance_time now, and is also needed.
