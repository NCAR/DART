This directory contains the source for two programs that together convert 
NCEP PREPBUFR files, which contain observational data, into the standard
DART obs_seq (observation sequence) file format.

The first is in the prep_bufr directory.  The program converts the raw
data files into an intermediate text format.
The format of this directory is different
from the standard layout of other DART directories since it mirrors
the prepbufr distribution as closely as possible.  To build the code,
run the 'install.sh' script.  The 'work' directory has examples and
scripts for running the code.

The second is in the ascii_to_obs directory.  The program reads the
intermediate text format and creates a DART obs_seq file format.
It is structured like the other DART directories; cd into the 'work'
subdirectory and run the 'quickbuild.sh' script.  It also contains
some example scripts for running the code.  See create_real_obs.html
for more documentation.
