This directory contains a very simple text input file
to use as an example of reading in text data.  The observations
are one per line, and the items on each line are space separated; 
fixed width columns work well, too.

In this simple example, the first item on each line is an observation 
type code (1=temperature, 2=wind). 

The next two are latitude/longitude locations.

The next is the vertical elevation.  For temperature it is
in meters, for winds it is in pressure.  Observations can
use either type of vertical units.

Then the time of the observation - year, month, day, hour, minute,
second.  

The last values are the actual observation values and an error
estimate.  For temperature it is degrees kelvin, +/- 2 degrees.
For wind, it is speed in m/s, direction in degrees, and an error
estimate of 4 m/s.

This is just an example that matches the read code in the
converter - any variation of this is easy to support, with
changes to the read lines to get the right information in
the right places.  If there is no error estimate (a common
problem), the converter can supply a reasonable fixed value.
