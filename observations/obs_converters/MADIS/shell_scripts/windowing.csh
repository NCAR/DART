# madis data window program -- reads hourly or daily obs_seq files
# by type, and outputs a single obs_seq file with all obs for that
# window.  the output file can then be input directly to the dart
# filter program, or can be input to the wrf preprocessor, which
# does superobs, excluding obs by region, edge processing for special
# wrf boundary condition handling, etc.
# 
# if no preprocessing is needed, this program may not be required.
# the individual madis files can be combined with the 'combine.csh' 
# script and those files can be input to filter.
#
# this script requires the executable 'advance_time' to be
# built and exist in the current directory, and advance_time
# requires an input.nml namelist file.
