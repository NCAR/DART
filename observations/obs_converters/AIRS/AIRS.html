<H2>Overview</H2>


<P>
The <a href="http://airs.jpl.nasa.gov/">AIRS</a>
instrument is an Atmospheric Infrared Sounder flying on the
<a href="http://aqua.nasa.gov/">Aqua</a> spacecraft.
Aqua is one of a group of satellites flying close together
in a polar orbit, collectively known as the "A-train".
The programs in this directory help to extract the
data from the distribution files and put them into
DART observation sequence (obs_seq) file format.
<br />
<br />
AIRS data includes atmospheric temperature in the troposphere,
derived moisture profiles, land and ocean surface temperatures,
surface emmissivity, cloud fraction, cloud top height,
and ozone burden in the atmosphere.

<H2>DATA SOURCES</H2>

<P>
Access to the web pages where the
AIRS data are stored is available by
<a href="https://airs.jpl.nasa.gov/data/registration">registering</a>
as a data user.
</P>

<P>
There are two products this converter can be used on: AIRX2RET, which is the
L2 standard retrieval product using AIRS IR and AMSU (without-HSB); and
AIRS2RET, which is the L2 standard retrieval product using AIRS IR-only.
More detailed information on the 
<a href="http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/AIRS/data-holdings/by-data-product-v5/airsL2_Std_AIRS_only.shtml">
AIRS2RET data product </a> and the
<a href="http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/AIRS/data-holdings/by-data-product/airsL2_Std.shtml">
AIRX2RET data product</a>
is available from the nasa web pages.
</P>

<P>
The data is distributed in
<a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/">HDF-4</a> format, using
some additional conventions for metadata called
<a href="http://hdfeos.org/software.php">HDF-EOS</a>.
There is a basic library for accessing data in hdf files,
and a variety of
<a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/products/index.html">generic tools</a>
that work with hdf files.
The specific libraries we use are the
<a href="http://hdfeos.org/software/library.php#HDF-EOS2">HDF-EOS2</a>
library built on HDF4.  The web page has a link to specific build
instructions.  Also, see <a href="#build">below</a> on this web page
for very specific instructions for getting the required software
and building it.  If you find more recent instructions online, use those.
But in the absence of anything else, it's someplace to start.
</P>
<P>
Besides the programs in this directory, a variety of
<a href="http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/AIRS/tools.shtml">specific tools</a>
targeted at AIRS data are available to help read and browse the data.
General information on using hdf in the earth sciences is available
<a href="http://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/HBDOCS/hdf.html">here</a>.
</P>

<P>
Several types of AIRS data, with varying levels of processing, are available.
The following descriptions are taken from the
<a href="http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/AIRS/documentation/v5_docs/AIRS_V5_Release_User_Docs/V5_Data_Release_UG.pdf">V5_Data_Release_UG</a> document:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The L1B data product includes geolocated, calibrated observed microwave,
infrared and visible/near infrared radiances, as well as Quality Assessment
(QA) data.  The radiances are well calibrated; however, not all QA data have
been validated.  Each product granule contains 6 minutes of data.  Thus there
are 240 granules of each L1B product produced every day.
</P>

<P>
The L2 data product includes geolocated, calibrated cloud-cleared radiances
and 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional retrieved physical quantities (e.g.,
surface properties and temperature, moisture, ozone, carbon monoxide and
methane profiles throughout the atmosphere).  Each product granule contains 6
minutes of data.  Thus there are 240 granules of each L2 product produced
every day.
</P>

<P>
The L3 data are created from the L2 data product by binning them in
1&deg;x1&deg;
grids.  There are three products: daily, 8-day and monthly.  Each product
provides separate ascending (daytime) and descending (nighttime) binned data
sets.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The converter in this directory processes level 2 (L2) data files, using
data set <tt>AIRS_DP</tt> and data product <tt>AIRX2RET</tt> or <tt>AIRS2RET</tt>
without <tt>HSB</tt> (the instrument measuring humidity which failed).
</P>

<P>
The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a facility instrument aboard
the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform,
EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit
(AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an
innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave
sensors. AIRS data will be generated continuously. Global coverage will
be obtained twice daily (day and night) on a 1:30pm sun synchronous orbit
from a 705-km altitude.
</P>
<P>
The AIRS Standard Retrieval Product consists of retrieved estimates of cloud
and surface properties, plus profiles of retrieved temperature, water vapor,
ozone, carbon monoxide and methane. Estimates of the errors associated with
these quantities will also be part of the Standard Product. The temperature
profile vertical resolution is 28 levels total between 1100 mb and 0.1 mb,
while moisture profile is reported at 14 atmospheric layers between 1100
mb and 50 mb. The horizontal resolution is 50 km. An AIRS granule has been
set as 6 minutes of data, 30 footprints cross track by 45 lines along track.

The Shortname for this product is AIRX2RET.  (AIRS2RET is the same product
but without the AMSU data.)
</P>

<P>
The converter outputs temperature observations at the corresponding vertical
pressure levels.  However, the moisture obs are the mean for the layer, so
the location in the vertical is the midpoint, in log space, of the current 
layer and the layer above it.   There is an alternative computation for the
moisture across the layer which may be more accurate, but requires a
forward operator subroutine to be written and for the observation to
contain metadata.  The observation could be defined with a layer top,
in pressure, and a number of points to use for the integration across
the layer.  Then the forward operator would query the model at each of
the N points in the vertical for a given horizontal location, and compute
the mean moisture value.  This code has not been implemented yet, and
would require a different QTY_xxx to distinguish it from the
simple location/value moisture obs.  See the GPS non-local operator
code for an example of how this would need to be implemented.
</P>

<P>
Getting the data currently means putting in a start/stop time at
<a href="http://mirador.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/mirador/homepageAlt.pl?keyword=AIRX2RET">this web page</a>.
The keyword is <tt>AIRX2RET</tt> and put in
the time range of interest and optionally a geographic region.  
Each file contains 6 minutes of data, is
about 2.3 Megabytes, and globally there are 240 files/day 
(about 550 Megabytes/day).
There are additional options for getting only particular variables of
interest, but the current reader expects whole files to be present.
Depending on your connection to the internet, there are various options
for downloading.  We have chosen to download a <tt>wget</tt> script which is
created by the web page after adding the selected files to a 'cart' 
and 'checking out'.  The script has a series of <tt>wget</tt> commands
which downloads each file, one at a time, which is run on the machine
where you want the data to end up.
</P>


<!--==================================================================-->

<A NAME="Programs"></A>
<HR />
<H2>PROGRAMS</H2>

<P>
The temperature observations are located on standard levels; there is a
single array of heights in each file and all temperature data is located
on one of these levels.  The moisture observations, however, are an
integrated quantity for the space between the levels; in their terminology
the fixed heights are 'levels' and the space between them are 'layers'.
The current converter locates the moisture obs at the midpoint, in log
space, between the levels.
</P>
<P>
The hdf files need to be downloaded from the data server, in any manner
you choose.   The converter program reads each hdf granule and outputs
a DART obs_seq file containing up to 56700 observations.  Only those with
a quality control of 0 (Best) are kept.
The resulting obs_seq files can be merged with the 
<a href="../../../assimilation_code/programs/obs_sequence_tool/obs_sequence_tool.html">obs_sequence_tool</a> 
into larger time periods.
</P>
<P>
It is possible to restrict the output observation sequence to contain
data from a region of interest throught the use of the namelist
parameters. If you need a region that spans the Prime Meridian
lon1 can be a larger number than lon2,
for example, a region from 300 E to 40 E and 60 S to 30 S (some of 
the South Atlantic), would be <em class="input">lon1 = 300, lon2 =
40, lat1 = -60, lat2 = -30</em>.
</P>
<P>
The scripts directory here includes some shell scripts that
make use of the fact that the AIRS data is also archived on the NCAR
HPSS (tape library) in daily tar files.  The script has options 
to download a day of granule files, convert them, merge them 
into daily files, and remove the
original data files and repeat the process for any specified
time period.  (See <tt>oneday_down.sh</tt>)
</P>

Here is a very specific script I used to build the required libraries
on a Linux cluster.  If you find more up-to-date instructions, use
those.  But in the absence of anything else, here's a place to start:

<H2>KNOWN BUGS</H2>
<P>
Earlier versions of this converter mistakenly put the moisture obs
at level heights, in the same location as the temperature observations.
The moisture observations are in fact an integrated value across the
distance between two levels.
This means the location was shifted 1/2 level in the vertical from 
the center of the layer.  The fixed converter outputs the location
at the center, in log space, of each layer.

If a more accurate moisture observation was needed, the observation value
could be computed by actually integrating multiple values between the levels.
At this point it doesn't seem necessary.
