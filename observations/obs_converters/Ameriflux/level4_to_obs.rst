PROGRAM ``level4_to_obs``
=========================

Overview
--------

AmeriFlux level 4 data to DART observation sequence converter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| This routine is designed to convert the flux tower Level 4 data from the `AmeriFlux <http://ameriflux.lbl.gov>`__
  network of observations from micrometeorological tower sites. AmeriFlux is part of
  `FLUXNET <http://fluxnet.ornl.gov>`__ and the converter is hoped to be a suitable starting point for the conversion of
  observations from FLUXNET. As of May 2012, I have not yet tried to work with any other observations from FLUXNET.
| The AmeriFlux Level 4 products are recorded using the local time. DART observation sequence files use GMT. For more
  information about AmeriFlux data products, go to http://ameriflux.lbl.gov.

.. warning::

   There was a pretty severe bug in the converter that swapped latent heat flux and sensible heat flux. The bug was
   present through revision 7200. It was corrected on 30 Dec 2016. 

The workflow is usually:

#. download the Level 4 data for the towers and years in question (see DATA SOURCES below)
#. record the TIME ZONE, latitude, longitude, and elevation for each tower
#. build the DART executables with support for the tower observations. This is done by running ``preprocess`` with
   ``obs_def_tower_mod.f90`` in the list of ``input_files`` for ``preprocess_nml``.
#. provide basic tower information via the ``level4_to_obs_nml`` namelist since this information is not contained in the
   Level 4 data file
#. convert each Level 4 data file individually using ``level4_to_obs``
#. combine all output files for the region and timeframe of interest into one file using
   :doc:`../../../assimilation_code/programs/obs_sequence_tool/obs_sequence_tool`

For some models (CLM, for example), it is required to reorganize the observation sequence files into a series of files
that contains ONLY the observations for each assimilation. This can be achieved with the `makedaily.sh <makedaily.sh>`__
script.

Namelist
--------

This namelist is read from the file ``input.nml``. Namelists start with an ampersand '&' and terminate with a slash '/'.
Character strings that contain a '/' must be enclosed in quotes to prevent them from prematurely terminating the
namelist.

Data sources
------------

| The data was acquired from http://cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/ameriflux/data/Level4/Sites_ByName
| and have names like
|  ``USBar2004_L4_h.txt, USHa12004_L4_h.txt, USNR12004_L4_h.txt``, 
|  ``USSP32004_L4_h.txt, USSRM2004_L4_h.txt, USWCr2004_L4_h.txt, USWrc2004_L4_h.txt, ...``
| The Level 4 products in question are ASCII files of comma-separated values taken every 30 minutes for an entire year.
  The first line is a comma-separated list of column descriptors, all subsequent lines are comma-separated numerical
  values. The converter presently searches for the columns pertaining to *NEE_or_fMDS*, *H_f*, *LE_f*, their
  corresponding quality control fields, and those columns pertaining to the time of the observation. These values are
  mapped as follows:

The ``LE_fqc``, ``H_fqc``, and ``NEE_or_fMDSqc`` variables use the following convention:

   0 = original, 1 = category A (most reliable), 2 = category B (medium), 3 = category C (least reliable). (Refer to
   Reichstein et al. 2005 Global Change Biology for more information)

   Please acknowledge the data source as a citation or in the acknowledgments if no citation is available. If the
   AmeriFlux Principal Investigators (PIs) feel that they should be acknowledged or offered participation as authors,
   they will let you know and we assume that an agreement on such matters will be reached before publishing and/or use

Programs
--------

The ``level4_to_obs.f90`` file is the source for the main converter program. Look at the source code where it reads the
example data file. You will almost certainly need to change the "read" statement to match your data format. The example
code reads each text line into a character buffer and then reads from that buffer to parse up the data items.

To compile and test, go into the work subdirectory and run the ``quickbuild.sh`` script to build the converter and a
couple of general purpose utilities. ``advance_time`` helps with calendar and time computations, and the
``obs_sequence_tool`` manipulates DART observation files once they have been created.

To change the observation types, look in the ``DART/obs_def`` directory. If you can find an obs_def_XXX_mod.f90 file
with an appropriate set of observation types, change the 'use' lines in the converter source to include those types.
Then add that filename in the ``input.nml`` namelist file to the &preprocess_nml namelist, the 'input_files' variable.
Multiple files can be listed. Then run quickbuild.sh again. It remakes the table of supported observation types before
trying to recompile the source code.

An example script for converting batches of files is in the ``shell_scripts`` directory. A tiny example data file is in
the ``data`` directory. These are *NOT* intended to be turnkey scripts; they will certainly need to be customized for
your use. There are comments at the top of the script saying what options they include, and should be commented enough
to indicate where changes will be likely to need to be made.

Decisions you might need to make
--------------------------------

See the discussion in the :doc:`../../../guide/creating-obs-seq-real` page about what options are available
for the things you need to specify. These include setting a time, specifying an expected error, setting a location, and
an observation type.
