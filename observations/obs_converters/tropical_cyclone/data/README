The example data file TC48_2012.atcf in this directory is one of the 
'b-deck' datasets for tropical cyclone #48 from 2012.  The converter 
code is set up to read this file.  

Lots of other text formats, spacing, column counts are available - the 
converter code may need the read format section changed for your use.

This converter must be compiled with obs_def_vortex_mod.f90 in the
&preprocess_nml :: input_files namelist.

Run the quickbuild.sh script in the ../work directory to build
the converter.

The other data file, bal012013.dat, is an example of one of the
many variants of the formatting where the columns are fixed width 
and there are more fields defined on each line.  The converter 
does not read this file as-is; it would need a new format line 
defined which matched these fields.  See tc_to_obs.f90 and
look for the 'select case' section where you can add new
sections to read in the data of interest.
