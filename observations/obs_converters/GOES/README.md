## NOAA GOES-R Series Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) Level 1b Radiances

The data are available from [NOAA-NCEI](https://data.nodc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ncdc:C01501)

The **convert_goes_ABI_L1b** program converts ABI Level 1b Radiances in netCDF format to a DART
observation sequence file with `GOES_16_ABI_RADIANCE` observations (there is a namelist option
to select other GOES satellites, which will have the appropriate observation type).

> The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) instrument samples the radiance of the 
Earth in sixteen spectral bands using several arrays of detectors in the 
instrument's focal plane. Single reflective band ABI Level 1b Radiance 
Products (channels 1 - 6 with approximate center wavelengths 0.47, 0.64, 
0.865, 1.378, 1.61, 2.25 microns, respectively) are digital maps of 
outgoing radiance values at the top of the atmosphere for visible and 
near-infrared (IR) bands. Single emissive band ABI L1b Radiance Products 
(channels 7 - 16 with approximate center wavelengths 3.9, 6.185, 6.95, 
7.34, 8.5, 9.61, 10.35, 11.2, 12.3, 13.3 microns, respectively) are 
digital maps of outgoing radiance values at the top of the atmosphere 
for IR bands. Detector samples are compressed, packetized and down-linked 
to the ground station as Level 0 data for conversion to calibrated, 
geo-located pixels (Level 1b Radiance data). The detector samples are 
decompressed, radiometrically corrected, navigated and resampled onto 
an invariant output grid, referred to as the ABI fixed grid.

### Specifying a vertical location 

Jeff Steward added (PR 48) the capability to specify a vertical location if desired.
This allows for localization in the vertical.
> It's sometimes helpful, even though definitely wrong from a theoretical standpoint, 
> to give a vertical location to satellite observations (which are integrated quantities). 
> This has been an issue with observation-space localization for some time, and this is 
> the standard workaround pioneered by Lili Lei and Jeff Whittaker.

### A short description of the namelist options

This table is meant to familiarize you with some of the options available. Until we fully implement
automatic documentation generation, you would be well advised to familiarize yourself with the code.
This is not the full list of namelist variables ...

| variable | default | meaning |
| :------- | :------ | :------ |
| x_thin | 0 | Skip this many per X scan. |
| y_thin | 0 | Skip this many per Y scan. |
| goes_num | 16 | GOES Satellite number. |
| reject_dqf_1 | .true. | Bad scan rejection criteria. If .true. and DQF /= 0, the scan is rejected. If .false. any DQF > 1 rejects the scan. |
| verbose | .false. | Run-time output verbosity |
| obs_err | MISSING_R8 | The observation error standard deviation (std dev, in radiance units) TODO: make this more sophisticated. You must supply a value other than MISSING_R8. Be aware that the observation sequence files convert this to a variance. |
| vloc_pres_hPa | -1.0 | The vertical location of this observation (hPa). A negative means there is no vertical location (which is typical for a vertically-integrated quantity). |
