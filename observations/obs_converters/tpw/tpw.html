<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>
Several satellites contain instruments that return
observations of integrated Total Precipitable Water (TPW).
There are two <a href="http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/">MODIS</a> 
Spectroradiometers, one aboard the 
<a href="http://terra.nasa.gov/">TERRA</a> satellite, and
the other aboard the <a href="http://aqua.nasa.gov/">AQUA</a> satellite.
There is also an
<a href="http://wwwghcc.msfc.nasa.gov/AMSR/">AMSR-E</a> instrument
on the AQUA satellite.
</P>

<P>
These instruments produce a variety of data products which are 
generally distributed in HDF format using the HDF-EOS libraries.
The converter code in this directory IS NOT USING THESE FILES
AS INPUT.  The code is expecting to read ASCII TEXT files, which
contain one line per observation, with the latitude,
longitude, TPW data value, and the observation time. The Fortran
read line is:
</P>
<pre>
      read(iunit, '(f11.6, f13.5, f10.4, 4x, i4, 4i3, f7.3)') &amp;
                lat, lon, tpw, iyear, imonth, iday, ihour, imin, seconds
</pre>
<P>
No program to convert between the HDF and text files
is currently provided.
Contact <a href="mailto:dart@ucar.edu">dart@ucar.edu</a>
for more information if you are interested in using this converter.
</P>


<!--==================================================================-->

<A NAME="DataSources"></A>
<HR />
<H2>DATA SOURCES</H2>

<P>
This converter reads files produced as part of a data research effort.  
Contact <a href="mailto:dart@ucar.edu">dart@ucar.edu</a>
for more information if you are interested in this data.
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, if you can read HDF-EOS files and output a text
line per observation in the format listed above, then you can
use this converter on TPW data from any MODIS file.
</P>


<!--==================================================================-->

<A NAME="Programs"></A>
<HR />
<H2>PROGRAMS</H2>
<P>
The programs in the <em class=file>DART/observations/tpw</em> 
directory extract data from the distribution text files 
and create DART observation sequence (obs_seq) files.
Build them in the <em class=file>work</em> directory by running
the <em class=program>./quickbuild.csh</em> script.  In addition
to the converters, several other general observation sequence
file utilities will be built.
</P>
<P>
Generally the input data comes in daily files, with the
string YYYYMMDD (year, month, day) as part of the name.
This converter has the option to loop over multiple days
within the same month and create an output file per day.
</P>
<P>
Like many kinds of satellite data, the TWP data is dense
and generally needs to be subsampled or averaged (super-ob'd)
before being used for data assimilation.  This converter 
will average in both space and time.  There are 4 namelist items
(see the <a href="#Namelist">namelist </a> section below) which
set the centers and widths of time bins for each day.  All observations
within a single time bin are eligible to be averaged together.
The next available observation in the bin is selected and any other 
remaining observations in that bin that are within delta latitude and 
delta longitude of it are averaged in both time and space.  Then all
observations which were averaged are removed from the bin, so each
observation is only averaged into one output observation.
Observations that are within delta longitude of the prime meridian
are handled correctly by averaging observations on both sides
of the boundary.
</P>
<P>
It is possible to restrict the output observation sequence to contain
data from a region of interest using namelist settings.
If your region spans the Prime Meridian
min_lon can be a larger number than max_lon.
For example, a region from 300 E to 40 E and 60 S to 30 S (some of
the South Atlantic), specify 
<em class="input">min_lon = 300, max_lon = 40, 
min_lat = -60, max_lat = -30</em>.
So 'min_lon' sets the western boundary, 'max_lon' the eastern.
</P>
<P>
The specific type of observation created in the output observation 
sequence file can be select by namelist.  "MODIS_TOTAL_PRECIPITABLE_WATER"
is the most general term, or a more satellite-specific name can be
chosen.  The choice of which observations to assimilate or evaluate
are made using this name.  The observation-space diagnostics also
aggregate statistics based on this name.
</P>

This namelist is read from the file <em class=file>input.nml</em>.

<TR>
 <TD> time_bin_start </TD>
 <TD> real(r8) </TD>
 <TD>The next four namelist values define a series of time intervals
that define time bins which are used for averaging.  The input data
from the satellite is very dense and generally the data values need
to be subsetted in some way before assimilating.
All observations in the same time bin are eligible to be averaged in
space if they are within the latitude/longitude box.  The input files
are distributed as daily files, so use care when defining the first
and last bins of the day.  The units are in hours.  This item defines
the midpoint of the first bin.
 </TD> </TR>

 <TD> time_bin_interval </TD>
 <TD> real(r8) </TD>

observation is selected.  All other observations in that bin that are
within delta latitude or longitude of it are averaged together and a single
observation is output.  Observations which are averaged with others
are removed from the bin and so only contribute to the output data once.

This program should use the HDF-EOS libraries to read the

This program could loop over arbitrary numbers of days by
using the time manager calendar functions to increment the
