The **M**icro**P**ulse **D**ifferential Absorption Lidar (**MPD**) data
were collected during field campaigns and testing periods by the
Earth Observing Laboratory (EOL).

The differential absorption lidar (DIAL) technique uses two separate 
laser wavelengths: an absorbing wavelength (online) and a non-absorbing 
wavelength (offline). The ratio of the range-resolved backscattered 
signals between the online and offline wavelengths is proportional to 
the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, which allows the retrieval 
of absolute humidity profiles above the lidar site. 

This observation converter takes absolute humidity (g/m3) profiles 
retrieved from the MPD data and converts them to the format used by DART.
The `obs_converter/MPD/work/convert_to_text.py` script reads the netCDF 
files from each MPD site and combines them into text files, one for each 
date and time. The `obs_converter/MPD/work/MPD_text_to_obs` program 
translates the text files to the DART `obs_seq.out` format.

Test data for a single site and an example output can be downloaded from
