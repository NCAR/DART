This is an example data file. It can be used as an input file
for the satellite chlorophyll (CHL) obs converter. The file 
contains raw CHL data that was downloaded using the script:
$DART/observations/obs_converters/ocean_color/shell_scripts/get_ocdata.sh

get_ocdata.sh downloads the data from the NASA ocean color 
webpage and modifies it. The modifications are minimal:
- Add a time dimension with the necessary attributes for 
the converter
- Crops the data into the requested domain (for instance, 
the Red Sea)
- It also runs the converter 
You can download as much data as you want by specifying 
a date range on top of the get_ocdata.sh script. 

There are two main sources for CHL data: 
[1] MODIS/AQUA: up to 2011
[2] VIIRS/SNNP: beond 2011 until present

An example data file looks like this:

``V2020350.L3m_DAY_SNPP_CHL_chlor_a_4km.nc``

where, 
- V      : letter representing either instrument (A/V)
- 2020350: $year$days; i.e., 350 into 2020 (Dec 15, 2020)
- L3m    : Mapping
- DAY    : Frequency
- SNPP   : intrument
- CHL    : variable
- chlor_a: obs name
- 4km    : resolution
