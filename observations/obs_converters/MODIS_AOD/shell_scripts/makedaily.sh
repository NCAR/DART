# Split a long file into "daily" files which start at 00:00Z the
# previous day and end at 23:59Z on the day that matches the day in the
# filename. This is only logical if you understand the CLM obs operator.
#
# The only flux tower forward observation operator is for CLM,
# which simply grabs values from a history file.
# The CLM h1 files contain everything STARTING with the time in their filename.
# all output intervals from that run are simply appended to that file.
# Consequently, we need to know the filename from the START of the model advance
# that resulted in the current model state.
#
#  | start of the model advance ... *.h1.* file starts getting written

#  |<------- hist_nhtfrq ------->|   |
