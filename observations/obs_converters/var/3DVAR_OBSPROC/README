Before building the executables in the work directory you 
will need to copy some of the WRF distribution files into 
this directory (DART/observations/obs_converters/var/3DVAR_OBSPROC).  The files listed below are what is needed 
with WRFDA v3.2.1 (the current release at this time). The files can be found here: [](https://github.com/wrf-model/WRF/tree/master/var/obsproc/MAP_plot)

From WRF/var/obsproc/MAP_plot/Dir_map, copy to here:

DA_Constants.f90
DA_Define_Structures.f90
DA_Read_Obs.inc
DA_Read_Obs_Info.inc
DA_Setup_Obs_Structures.inc
module_obs.F90

As well as from WRF/var/obsproc/MAP_plot/include, copy to here:
