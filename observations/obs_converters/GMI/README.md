This directory contains the code to convert the GMI Brightness Temperatures in HDF5 format
to the DART observation sequence file format.

The datset of interest is: "GPM GMI Common Calibrated Brightness Temperatures 
Collocated L1C 1.5 hours 13 km V05 (GPM_1CGPMGMI) at GES DISC" **NOT the _R** set!
The _short name_ for this dataset is 'GPM_1CGPMGMI'.

The introductory paragraph for the dataset is:

> Version 5 is the current version of the data set.
> Version 4 is no longer available and has been superseded by Version 5. 
> All 1C products have a common L1C data structure, simple and generic. 
> Each L1C swath includes scan time, latitude and longitude, scan status, 
> quality, incidence angle, Sun glint angle, and the intercalibrated 
> brightness temperature (Tc). One or more swaths are included in a product. 
> The radiometer data are recalibrated to a common basis so that 
> precipitation products derived from them are consistent. 
> 1CGMI contains common calibrated brightness temperatures from the 
> GMI passive microwave instrument flown on the GPM satellite. 
> 1C-R GMI is a remapped version of 1CGMI which is explained at the end 
> of this section. Swath S1 has 9 channels which are similar to 
> TRMM TMI (10V 10H 19V 19H 23V 37V 37H 89V 89H). 
> Swath S2 has 4 channels similar to AMSU-B (166V 166H 183+/-3V 183+/-8V). 
> Data for both swaths is observed in the same revolution of the instrument.

## Instructions to download the GPM_1CGPMGMI dataset for the GMI converter

1. Go to https://earthdata.nasa.gov
2. Log in (or create an account if necessary) 
2. Search for GMI L1C (the "c" here is for cross-calibrated with other satellites)
3. Scroll down past datasets to "Matching results."
  - Follow the link to the GMI common calibrated data set: "GPM GMI Common Calibrated Brightness Temperatures Collocated L1C 1.5 hours 13 km V05 (GPM_1CGPMGMI) at GES DISC" dataset (**NOT the _R** set)
4. You should now be at the https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/concepts/C1383813813-GES_DISC.html page.
  - Select the 'Download data' tab
  - Select 'Earthdata search'
  - Select the GPM link under 'Matching datasets'
5. You can now select 'Granule filters' to choose your start and end dates.
6. Select the granules you want, then click 'download all' and 'download data'
7. Click download access script
8. Follow the instructions on that page to download the data. 

Each granule is about 28M and has names like:  
`1C.GPM.GMI.XCAL2016-C.20160621-S001235-E014508.013137.V05A.HDF5`


## Guidelines for converting the observations, thinning, superobbing, etc.

are forthcoming. For more background on assimilating radiances in DART, please read
https://dart.ucar.edu/pages/Radiance_support.html

When running the DART converter, two swaths (S1, S2) are converted to observations.
S1 and S2 have different channels and different "postings," meaning actual 
observation locations. They are more or less right next to each other ...

https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/GPM_1CGPMGMI_05/summary

Swath S1 has 9 channels which are similar to TRMM TMI (10V 10H 19V 19H 23V 37V 37H 89V 89H).  
Swath S2 has 4 channels similar to AMSU-B (166V 166H 183+/-3V 183+/-8V).  
Data for both swaths is observed in the same revolution of the instrument.  

Partial run-time output for one file (no thinning, whole globe, i.e. about 8 million observations):
