This directory contains conversion programs for various
obs formats related to 3D-Var, WRF-Var, and MM5:

- to and back from little-r format, temperature and winds only.
- from gts to dart.
- the radar 3d-var obs only to dart format.

You need to add some WRF-Var source files to the 3DVAR_OBSPROC
directory, and then you can go into the work directory and
run the 'quickbuild.csh' script.

The little-r converter may need changes to the code to convert
from the original quality control flags into QC flags compatible
with DART.  (in DART, 0 is good data.)

The GTS converter does not support SATEM thickness data but
there are versions around which do; write dart@ucar.edu if you
are interested in more about this.

And a final disclaimer: 
Whether these work with the latest 3D-Var format is untested
at this point.  Please contact the DART Development group if
you are interested in using these tools.
