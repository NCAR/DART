02 B     SSM/I OCEANIC WIND SPEED REPORT.  PERFROMS A    WRC-> UOB,VOB= #, WQM= 2 
         MULTIVARIATE SURFACE WIND ANALYSIS AND ASSIGNS 
         THE ANALYZED DIRECTION TO THE WIND SPEED
         OBSERVATION.  THEN GENERATES NEW U- AND 
         V-COMPONENTS FOR THE WIND VECTOR.

04 B     OBSERVATION ORIGINALLY WITH A KEEP FLAG (=0)    PRC-> PQM=4 TRC-> TQM=4 WRC-> WQM=4
         IS REJECTED BECAUSE IT IS MORE THAN 20 TIMES 
         THE EXPECTED DIFFERENCE FROM THE INTERPOLATED
         NEARBY INDEPENDENT INFORMATION.

05 B     OBSERVATION ORIGINALLY WITH A GOOD QUALITY      PRC-> PQM=5 
         MARK (=1) IS REJECTED BY THE OIQC CHECKING      TRC-> TQM=5 
         ALGORITHM.                                      WRC-> WQM=5 

06 B     OBSERVATION ORIGINALLY WITH A NEUTRAL           PRC-> PQM=6 
         QUALITY MARK (=2) IS REJECTED BY THE OIQC       TRC-> TQM=6 
         CHECKING ALGORITHM.                             WRC-> WQM=6 

07 B     OBSERVATION ORIGINALLY WITH A SUSPECT           PRC-> PQM=7 
         QUALITY MARK (=3) IS REJECTED BY THE OIQC       TRC-> TQM=7 
         CHECKING ALGORITHM.                             WRC-> WQM=7
