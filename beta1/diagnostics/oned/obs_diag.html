<H2>Overview/Usage</H2>

<P>
   Main program for observation-space diagnostics for the models with
   1D locations. 18 quantities are calculated for each region for each
   temporal bin specified by user input.  The result of the code is a netCDF
   file that contains the 18 quantities of the prior (aka 'guess') and
   posterior (aka 'analysis') estimates as a function of time and region as
   well as all the metadata to create meaningful figures.
</P>
<P>
   Each <em class="file">obs_seq.final</em> file contains an observation
   sequence that has multiple 'copies' of the observation. One copy is
   the actual observation, another copy is the prior ensemble mean estimate
   of the observation, one is the spread of the prior ensemble estimate,
   one may be the prior estimate from ensemble member 1, ... etc.
   The only observations for the 1D models are the result of a
   'perfect model' experiment, so there is an additional copy called
   the 'truth' - the noise-free expected observation given the true
   model state.  Since this copy does not, in general, exist for the
   high-order models, all comparisons are made with the copy labelled
   'observation'. It may, in some instances be useful to compare against
   the 'truth', in which case you will have to hand-edit the code and
   recompile. Caveat emptor.
</P>
<P>
   Each ensemble member applies a forward operator to the state to compute
   the "expected" value of an observation. Given multiple estimates of
   the observation, several quantities can be calculated. It is possible to
   compute the expected observations from the state vector before
   assimilating (the "guess", "forecast", or "prior") or after the
   assimilation (the "analysis", or "posterior").
</P>
<P>
   Even with <em class="file">input.nml</em>:<em class="code">filter_nml:num_output_obs_members</em>
   set to <em class="code">0</em>; the full [prior,posterior] ensemble mean
   and [prior,posterior] ensemble spread are preserved in the
   <em class="file">obs_seq.final</em> file. Consequently, the ensemble
   means and spreads are used to calculate the diagnostics.  If the
   <em class="file">input.nml</em>:<em class="code">filter_nml:num_output_obs_members</em>
   is set to <em class="code">80</em> (for example); the first 80 ensemble
   members prior and posterior "expected" values of the observation are
   also included.  In this case, the <em class="file">obs_seq.final</em>
   file contains enough information to calculate a rank histograms,
   verify forecasts, etc.
   The ensemble means are still used for many other calculations.
</P>

<P>
   <em class="program">obs_diag</em> is designed to explore the effect of
   the assimilation in two ways; 1) as a function of time for a particular
   variable (this is the figure on the left), and sometimes
   2) in terms of a rank histogram - "Where does the actual observation rank
   relative to the  rest of the ensemble?" (figure on the right).
   The figures were created by Matlab&#174;
   scripts that query the <em class="file">obs_diag_output.nc</em> file:
   <em class="file">DART/diagnostics/matlab/<a href="https://proxy.subversion.ucar.edu/DAReS/DART/trunk/diagnostics/matlab/plot_evolution.m">plot_evolution.m</a></em> and
   <a href="https://proxy.subversion.ucar.edu/DAReS/DART/trunk/diagnostics/matlab/plot_rank_histogram.m">plot_rank_histogram.m</a>.
   Both of these takes as input a
   file name and a 'quantity' to plot ('rmse', 'spread', 'totalspread',&nbsp;...)
   and exhaustively plots the quantity (for every variable,
   every region) in a single matlab figure window  - and creates a series
   of .ps files with multiple pages for each of the figures.
   The directory gets cluttered with them.
</P>

<P>
   The observation sequence files contain only the time of the observation,
   nothing of the assimilation interval, etc. - so it requires user guidance
   to declare what sort of temporal binning for the temporal evolution
   plots. I do a 'bunch' of arithmetic on the namelist times to convert
   them to a series of temporal bin edges that are used when traversing
   the observation sequence. The actual algorithm is that the user input for
   the start date and bin width set up a sequence that ends in one of two ways ...
   the last time is reached or the number of bins has been reached.
   <strong>NOTE:</strong> for the purpose of interpretability,
   the 1D <em class=program>obs_diag</em> routines saves 'dates' as
   GREGORIAN dates despite the fact these systems have no concept of a calendar.
</P>
<P>
   <em class=program>obs_diag</em> reads <em class=file>obs_seq.final</em>
   files and calculates the following quantities (in no particular order)
   for an arbitrary number of regions and levels. It is necessary to query
   the <em class=code>CopyMetaData</em> variable to determine the storage order
   (i.e. "which copy is what?").

<A NAME="New"></A>
<div class="top">[<a href="#">top</a>]</div><hr />
<H2>What is new in the Lanai Release.</H2>
<P>
   <em class=program>obs_diag</em> has several improvements:
</P>
<ol>
    <li>Support for 'trusted' observations. Trusted observation types may
        be specified in the namelist and all observations of that type will
        be counted in the statistics despite the DART QC code (as long as the
        forward observation operator succeeds).
        See namelist variable <em class=code>trusted_obs</em>.
        </li><br />
    <li>Support for 'true' observations (i.e. from an OSSE). If the
        'truth' copy of an observation is desired for comparison (instead of
        the default copy) the observation error variance is set to 0.0
        and the statistics are calculated relative to the 'truth' copy
        (as opposed to the normal 'noisy' or 'observation' copy).
        See namelist variable <em class=code>use_zero_error_obs</em>.
        </li><br />
    <li>discontinued the use of <em class=code>rat_cri</em> and
        <em class=code>input_qc_threshold</em> namelist variables.
        Their functionality was replaced by the DART QC mechanism long ago.
        </li><br />
     <li>The creation of the rank histogram (if possible) is now
        namelist-controlled by
        namelist variable <em class=code>create_rank_histogram</em>.
        </li>
</ol>

<P>
The allowable ranges for the region boundaries are: lon [0.0, 1.0).
The 1D locations are conceived as the distance around a unit sphere.
An observation with a location exactly ON a region boundary cannot
'count' for both regions. The logic used to resolve this is:
</P>
<blockquote>if((lon &ge; lon1) .and. (lon &lt; lon2)) keeper = .true.</blockquote>
<br />
<P>
   Consequently, if you want to include an observation precisely AT 1.0, (for example),    you need to specify something a little larger than 1.0.<br /><br />
   You can only specify <strong>either</strong>
   <em class="code">obs_sequence_name</em>
   <strong>or</strong>
   <em class="code">obs_sequence_list</em> -- not both.
   One of them has to be an empty string ... i.e. <em class="code">''</em>.

    <TD> character </TD>
    <TD>Name of the observation sequence file(s). <br />
    This may be a relative or absolute filename. If the filename contains a '/',
    the filename is considered to be comprised of everything to the right, and a
    directory structure to the left.  The directory structure is then queried to
    see if it can be incremented to handle a sequence of observation files.  The
    default behavior of <em class="program">obs_diag</em> is to look for
    additional files to include until the files are exhausted or an
    <em class=file>obs_seq.final</em> file is found that contains observations
    beyond the timeframe of interest.<br />e.g. 'obsdir_001/obs_seq.final'
    will cause <em class="program">obs_diag</em> to look for
    'obsdir_002/obs_seq.final', and so on.
    <br />
    If this is set, <em class=code>obs_sequence_list</em> must be set to a

<H3 class=indent1>Discussion of obs_diag_output.nc</H3>

<P>
Every observation type encountered in the observation sequence file is
tracked separately, and aggregated into temporal and 3D spatial bins.
There are two main efforts to this program. One is to track the temporal
evolution of any of the quantities available in the netCDF file for any
possible observation type:
</P>
<div class="unix">ncdump -v CopyMetaData,ObservationTypes obs_diag_output.nc</div>
<P>
The other is to explore the vertical profile of a particular observation
kind. By default, each observation kind has a 'guess/prior' value and
an 'analysis/posterior' value - which shed some insight into the
innovations.
</P>

<H4 class=indent1>temporal evolution</H4>

<P>
The <em class="file">obs_diag_output.nc</em> output file has all the
metadata I could think of, as well as separate variables for every
observation type in the observation sequence file. Furthermore, there
is a separate variable for the 'guess/prior' and 'analysis/posterior'
estimate of the observation. To distinguish between the two, a suffix
is appended to the variable name.  An example seems appropriate:
</P>
<pre>
  ...
  char CopyMetaData(copy, stringlength) ;
          CopyMetaData:long_name = "quantity names" ;
  ...
  int rank_bins(rank_bins) ;
          rank_bins:long_name = "rank histogram bins" ;
          rank_bins:comment = "position of the observation among the sorted noisy ensemble members" ;
  float RAW_STATE_VARIABLE_guess(time, copy, region) ;
          RAW_STATE_VARIABLE_guess:_FillValue = -888888.f ;
          RAW_STATE_VARIABLE_guess:missing_value = -888888.f ;
  float RAW_STATE_VARIABLE_analy(time, copy, region) ;
          RAW_STATE_VARIABLE_analy:_FillValue = -888888.f ;
          RAW_STATE_VARIABLE_analy:missing_value = -888888.f ;
  ...
</pre>

<H4 class=indent1>rank histograms</H4>
<P>
If it is possible to calculate a rank histogram, there will also be :</P>
<pre>
  ...
  int RAW_STATE_VARIABLE_guess_RankHist(time, rank_bins, region) ;
  ...
</pre>
<P>
as well as some global attributes. The attributes reflect the namelist settings
and can be used by plotting routines to provide additional annotation for
the histogram.
</P>
<pre>
                :DART_QCs_in_histogram = 0, 1, 2, 3, 7 ;
                :outliers_in_histogram = "TRUE" ;
</pre>
<P>
Please note:<br />
netCDF restricts variable names to 40 characters, so '_Rank_Hist'
may be truncated.
