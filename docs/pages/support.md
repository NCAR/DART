## Support

Please send email to [dart@ucar.edu](mailto:dart@ucar.edu) rather than individuals.
It is the best way to ensure a timely response and sometimes generates productive
discussion among our group that leads to a better response.

GitHub also provides a [wiki](https://github.com/NCAR/DART_development/wiki) that
we will be using to add examples and appropriate content.

Lastly, GitHub also provides a [bug-reporting](https://github.com/NCAR/DART_development/issues)
facility.

### Svn to Git

We will populate this with advice on how to migrate the changes from your local svn version of DART to
the equivalent git version. From there, you can choose to merge to a more current branch or tag.
Stay Tuned\!
