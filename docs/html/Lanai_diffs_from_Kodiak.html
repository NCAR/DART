<A NAME="Overview"></A>
<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>
This document includes an overview of the changes in the DART
system since the Kodiak release.  For further details on any of
these items look at the HTML documentation for that specific part
of the system.
</P>
<P>
There is a longer companion document for this release, the
<a href="Lanai_release.html">Lanai Release Notes</a>, which
include installation instructions, a walk-through of running
one of the low-order models, the diagnostics, and a description
of non-backward compatible changes.  See the 
<a href="Lanai_release.html#CurrentUsers">Notes for Current Users</a>
section for additional information on changes in this release.

<A NAME="Changes"></A>
<div class="top">[<a href="#">top</a>]</div><hr />
<H2>Changes to Core DART routines</H2>
<P>
This section describes changes in the basic DART library routines
since the Kodiak release.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Added a completely new random number generator based on the Mersenne
Twister algorithm from the GNU scientific library. It seems to have better
behavior if reseeded frequently, which is a possible usage pattern if
perfect_model_obs is run for only single steps and the model is advanced in
an external script. As part of this code update all random number code was
moved into the random_seq_mod and random_nr_mod is deprecated.</LI>
<LI>Perfect_model_obs calls a seed routine in the time manager now that
generates a consistent seed based on the current time of the state. This
makes subsequent runs give consistent results and yet separate runs don't get
identical error values.</LI>
<LI>Added random number generator seeds in several routines to try to get
consistent results no matter how many MPI tasks the code was run with. This includes:
<UL>
<LI>cam model_mod.f90, pert_model_state()</LI>
<LI>assim_tools_mod.f90, filter_assim(), filter kinds 2, 3, and 5</LI>
<LI>wrf model_mod.f90, pert_model_state()</LI>
<LI>adaptive_inflate_mod.f90, adaptive_inflate_init(), non-deterministic inf</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>There is a new &amp;filter_nml namelist item: enable_special_outlier_code.
If .true. the DART quality control code will call a separate subroutine at
the end of filter.f90 to evaluate the outlier threshold.  The user can add
code to that routine to change the threshold based on observation type or
values as they wish.  If .false. the default filter outlier threshold code
will be called and the user routine ignored.</LI>
<LI>If your <em class=file>model_mod.f90</em> provides a customized 
<em class=code>get_close_obs()</em> routine that makes use of the 
types/kinds arguments for either the base location or the close location list, 
there is an important change in this release.  The fifth
argument to the <em class=code>get_close_obs()</em> call is now a list of 
generic kinds corresponding to the location list.  The fourth argument to
the <em class=code>get_dist()</em> routine is now also a generic kind and
not a specific type.  In previous versions of the system the list
of close locations was sometimes a list of specific types and other
times a list of generic kinds. The system now
always passes generic kinds for the close locations list for consistency.
The base location and specific type remains the same as before.  If you
have a <em class=code>get_close_obs()</em> routine in your <em class=file>
model_mod.f90</em> file and have questions about usage, 
<a href="mailto:dart@ucar.edu">contact</a> the DART development team.</LI>
<LI>Filter will call the end_model() subroutine in the model_mod for
the first time.  It should have been called all along, but was not.</LI>
<LI>Added a time sort routine in the time_manager_mod.</LI>
<LI>Avoid a pair of all-to-all transposes when setting the inflation mean and
sd from the namelist. The new code finds the task which has the two copies
and sets them directly without a transpose. The log messages were also moved
to the end of the routine - if you read in the mean/sd values from a restart
file the log messages that printed out the min/max values needed to be after
the read from the file.</LI>
<LI>Reordered the send/receive loops in the all-to-all transposes to scale
better on yellowstone.</LI>
<LI>Remove a state-vector size array from the stack in
read_ensemble_restart(). The array is now allocated only if needed and then
deallocated. The ensemble write routine was changed before the Kodiak release
but the same code in read was apparently not changed simply as an
oversight.</LI>
<LI>If the ensemble mean is selected to be written out in dart restart file
format, the date might not have been updated correctly. The code was fixed to
ensure the ensemble mean date in the file was correct.</LI>
<LI>filter writes the ensemble size into the log file.</LI>
<LI>Reorganized the code in the section of obs_model_mod that prints out the
time windows, with and without verbose details. Should be clearer if the next
observation is in or out of the current assimilation window, and if the model
needs to advance or not.</LI>
<LI>Added a fill_inflation_restart utility which can write a file with a
fixed mean and sd, so the first step of a long assimilation run can use the
same 'start_from_restart_file' as subsequent steps.</LI>
<LI>Added new location module options:
<UL>
<LI>Channel coordinate system</LI>
<LI>[0-1] periodic 3D coordinate system</LI>
<LI>X,Y,Z 3D Cartesian coordinate system</LI>
<LI>2D annulus coordinate system</LI>
</UL>
</LI>

<A NAME="NewModels"></A>
<hr />
<H2>New Models or Changes to Existing Models</H2>
<P>
Several new models have been incorporated into DART.  This section details
both changes to existing models and descriptions of new models that have
been added since the Kodiak release.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Support for components under the CESM framework:
<UL>
<LI>Added support for the Community Land Model (CLM).</LI>
<LI>Added support to run the Community Atmospheric Model (CAM) under the 
CESM framework.</LI>
<LI>Added support for the CESM 1.1.1 release for CAM, POP, CLM: includes
experiment setup scripts and assimilation scripts.</LI>
<LI>CAM, POP, and/or CLM can be assimilated either individually or
in combination while running under the CESM framework.
If assimilating into multiple components, 
they are assimilated sequentially with observations only affecting
a single component directly. Other components are indirectly affected
through interactions with the coupler.</LI>
<LI>Setup scripts are provided to configure a CESM experiment using
the multi-instance feature of CESM to support ensembles for assimilation.</LI>
<LI>POP state vector contains potential temperature; observations from the
World Ocean Database are in-situ or sensible temperature.  The model_mod
now corrects for this.
<UL>
<LI>The state vector has all along contained potential temperature and not
in-situ (sensible) temperature. The observations from the World Ocean
Database are of sensible temperature. Changed the specific kind in the
model_mod to be <tt>QTY_POTENTIAL_TEMPERATURE</tt> and added new code to
convert from potential to in-situ temperature. Differences for even the
deeper obs (4-5km) is still small ( ~ 0.2 degree). (in-situ or sensible
temperature is what you measure with a regular thermometer.)</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>Support for the SE core (HOMME) of CAM has been developed but
<strong>is not</strong> part of the current release.  Contact the
DART group if you have an interest in running this configuration of CAM.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>Changes to the WRF model_mod:
<UL>
<LI>Allow advanced microphysics schemes (needed interpolation for 7 new kinds)</LI>
<LI>Interpolation in the vertical is done in log(p) instead of linear
pressure space.  log(p) is the default, but a compile-time variable can
restore the linear interpolation.</LI>
<LI>Added support in the namelist to avoid writing updated fields back into
the wrf netcdf files. The fields are still updated during the assimilation
but the updated data is not written back to the wrfinput file during the
dart_to_wrf step.</LI>
<LI>Fixed an obscure bug in the vertical convert routine of the wrf model_mod
that would occasionally fail to convert an obs. This would make tiny
differences in the output as the number of mpi tasks change. No quantitative
differences in the results but they were not bitwise compatible before and they
are again now.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>Added support for the MPAS_ATM and MPAS_OCN models.
<UL>
<LI>Added interpolation routines for the voroni-tesselation grid (roughly hexagonal)
<LI>Includes vertical conversion routines for vertical localization.
<LI>Added code to the mpas_atm model to interpolate specific humidity and
pressure, so we can assimilate GPS obs now.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>Added support for the 'SQG' uniform PV two-surface QC+1 spectral model.</LI>
<LI>Added support for a flux-transport solar dynamo model.</LI>
<LI>Added support for the GITM upper atmosphere model.</LI>
<LI>Added support for the NOAH land model.</LI>
<LI>Added support for the NAAPS model.</LI>
<LI>Added model_mod interface code for the NOGAPS model to the SVN repository.</LI>
<LI>Simple advection model:
<UL>
<LI>Fix where the random number seed is set in the models/simple_advection
model_mod - it needed to be sooner than it was being called.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</UL>

<A NAME="ForwardOps"></A>
<div class="top">[<a href="#">top</a>]</div><hr />
<H2>New or changed Forward Operators</H2>
<P>
This section describes changes to the Foward Operators and
new Generic Kinds or Specific Types that have been added
since the Kodiak release.
</P>


<UL>
<LI>Many new kinds added to the DEFAULT_obs_kind_mod.f90:
<UL>
<LI>QTY_CANOPY_WATER</LI>
<LI>QTY_CARBON</LI>
<LI>QTY_CLW_PATH</LI>
<LI>QTY_DIFFERENTIAL_REFLECTIVITY</LI>
<LI>QTY_DUST</LI>
<LI>QTY_EDGE_NORMAL_SPEED</LI>
<LI>QTY_FLASH_RATE_2D</LI>
<LI>QTY_GRAUPEL_VOLUME</LI>
<LI>QTY_GROUND_HEAT_FLUX QTY_HAIL_MIXING_RATIO</LI>
<LI>QTY_HAIL_NUMBER_CONCENTR</LI>
<LI>QTY_HAIL_VOLUME QTY_ICE QTY_INTEGRATED_AOD</LI>
<LI>QTY_INTEGRATED_DUST</LI>
<LI>QTY_INTEGRATED_SEASALT QTY_INTEGRATED_SMOKE</LI>
<LI>QTY_INTEGRATED_SULFATE</LI>
<LI>QTY_LATENT_HEAT_FLUX</LI>
<LI>QTY_LEAF_AREA_INDEX</LI>
<LI>QTY_LEAF_CARBON</LI>
<LI>QTY_LEAF_NITROGEN QTY_LIQUID_WATER</LI>
<LI>QTY_MICROWAVE_BRIGHT_TEMP</LI>
<LI>QTY_NET_CARBON_FLUX</LI>
<LI>QTY_NET_CARBON_PRODUCTION</LI>
<LI>QTY_NEUTRON_INTENSITY</LI>
<LI>QTY_NITROGEN QTY_RADIATION</LI>
<LI>QTY_ROOT_CARBON</LI>
<LI>QTY_ROOT_NITROGEN</LI>
<LI>QTY_SEASALT</LI>
<LI>QTY_SENSIBLE_HEAT_FLUX</LI>
<LI>QTY_SMOKE</LI>
<LI>QTY_SNOWCOVER_FRAC</LI>
<LI>QTY_SNOW_THICKNESS</LI>
<LI>QTY_SNOW_WATER</LI>
<LI>QTY_SO2</LI>
<LI>QTY_SOIL_CARBON</LI>
<LI>QTY_SOIL_NITROGEN</LI>
<LI>QTY_SPECIFIC_DIFFERENTIAL_PHASE</LI>
<LI>QTY_STEM_CARBON</LI>
<LI>QTY_STEM_NITROGEN</LI>
<LI>QTY_SULFATE</LI>
<LI>QTY_VORTEX_WMAX</LI>
<LI>QTY_WATER_TABLE_DEPTH</LI>
<LI>QTY_WIND_TURBINE_POWER</LI>
<LI>plus slots 151-250 reserved for Chemistry (specifically WRF-Chem) kinds</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>Added a forward operator for total precipitable water. It loops over
model levels so it can be used as an example of how to handle this without
having to hardcode the number of levels into the operator.</LI>
<LI>Added a forward operator (and obs_seq file converter) for COSMOS ground
moisture observations.</LI>
<LI>Added a forward operator (and obs_seq file converter) for MIDAS
observations of Total Electron Count.</LI>
<LI>Added a 'set_1d_integral()' routine to the obs_def_1d_state_mod.f90
forward operator for the low order models. This subroutine isn't used by
filter but it would be needed if someone wanted to write a standalone program
to generate obs of this type. We use this file as an example of how to write
an obs type that has metadata, but we need to give an example of how to set
the metadata if you aren't using create_obs_sequence interactively (e.g. your
data is in netcdf and you have a separate converter program.)</LI>
</UL>


<!--==================================================================-->

<A NAME="ObsConvert"></A>
<div class="top">[<a href="#">top</a>]</div><hr />
<H2>Observation Converters</H2>
<P>
This section describes
support for new observation types or sources
that have been added since the Kodiak release.
</P>


<UL>
<LI>Added an obs_sequence converter for wind profiler data from MADIS.</LI>
<LI>Added an obs_sequence converter for Ameriflux land observations(latent
heat flux, sensible heat flux, net ecosystem production).</LI>
<LI>Added an obs_sequence converter for MODIS snow coverage measurements.</LI>
<LI>Added an obs_sequence converter for COSMOS ground moisture observations.</LI>
<LI>Added an obs_sequence converter for MIDAS observations of Total Electron Count.</LI>
<LI>Updated scripts for the GPS converter; added options to convert data from
multiple satellites.</LI>
<LI>More scripting support in the MADIS obs converters; more error checks
added to the rawin converter.</LI>
<LI>Added processing for wind profiler observation to the
wrf_dart_obs_preprocess program.</LI>
<LI>Fix BUG in airs converter - the humidity obs are accumulated across the
layers and so the best location for them is the layer midpoint and not on the
edges (levels) as the temperature obs are. Also fixed off-by-one error where
the converter would make one more obs above the requested top level.</LI>
<LI>Made gts_to_dart converter create separate obs types for surface dewpoint
vs obs aloft because they have different vertical coordinates.</LI>
<LI>Converted mss commands to hpss commands for a couple observation
converter shell scripts (inc AIRS).</LI>
<LI>New matlab code to generate evenly spaced observations on the surface of
a sphere (e.g. the globe).</LI>
<LI>Added obs_loop.f90 example file in obs_sequence directory; example
template for how to construct special purpose obs_sequence tools.</LI>
<LI>Change the default in the script for the prepbufr converter so it will
swap bytes, since all machines except ibms will need this now.</LI>
<LI>The 'wrf_dart_obs_preprocess' program now refuses to superob observations
that include the pole, since the simple averaging of latitude and longitude
that works everyplace else won't work there.  Also treats observations near
the prime meridian more correctly.</LI>
</UL>


<!--==================================================================-->

<A NAME="Diagnostics"></A>
<div class="top">[<a href="#">top</a>]</div><hr />
<H2>New or updated DART Diagnostics</H2>
<P>
This section describes new or updated diagnostic
routines that have been added since the Kodiak release.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Handle empty epochs in the obs_seq_to_netcdf converter.</LI>
<LI>Added a matlab utility to show the output of a 'hop' test (running a
model for a continuous period vs. stopping and restarting a run).</LI>
<LI>Improved the routine that computes axes tick values in plots with 
multiple values plotted on the same plot.</LI>
<LI>The obs_common_subset program can select common observations from up to 4
observation sequence files at a time.</LI>
<LI>Add code in obs_seq_verify to ensure that the ensemble members are in the
same order in all netcdf files.</LI>
<LI>Added support for the unstructured grids of mpas to our matlab  diagnostics.</LI>
<LI>Fix to writing of ReportTime in obs_seq_coverage.</LI>
<LI>Fixed logic in obs_seq_verify when determining the forecast lat.</LI>
<LI>Fixed loops inside obs_seq_coverage which were using the wrong limits on
the loops. Fixed writing of 'ntimes' in output netcdf variable.</LI>
<LI>The obs_common_subset tool supports comparing more than 2 obs_seq.final
files at a time, and will loop over sets of files.</LI>
<LI>Rewrote the algorithm in the obs_selection tool so it had better scaling
with large numbers of obs.</LI>
<LI>Several improvements to the 'obs_diag' program:
<UL>
<LI>Added preliminary support for a list of 'trusted obs' in the obs_diag
program.</LI>
<LI>Can disable the rank histogram generation with a namelist item.</LI>
<LI>Can define height_edges or heights in the namelist, but not both.</LI>
<LI>The 'rat_cri' namelist item (critical ratio) has been deprecated.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>Extend obs_seq_verify so it can be used for forecasts from a single
member. minor changes to obs_selection, obs_seq_coverage and obs_seq_verify
to support a single member.</LI>
<LI>Added Matlab script to read/print timestamps from binary dart restart/ic
files.</LI>
<LI>Default for obs_seq_to_netcdf in all the namelists is now 'one big time
bin' so you don't have to know the exact timespan of an obs_seq.final file
before converting to netCDF.</LI>
</UL>


<!--==================================================================-->

<A NAME="Misc"></A>
<div class="top">[<a href="#">top</a>]</div><hr />
<H2>Tutorial, Scripting, Setup, Builds</H2>
<P>
This section describes
updates and changes to the tutorial materials,
scripting, setup, and build information 
since the Kodiak release.
</P>


<UL>
<LI>The mkmf-generated Makefiles now take care of calling 'fixsystem' if
needed so the mpi utilities code compiles without further user
intervention.</LI>
<LI>Make the default input.nml for the Lorenz 96 and Lorenz 63 model gives
good assimilation results. Rename the original input.nml to
input.workshop.nml. The workshop_setup script renames it back before doing
anything else so this won't break the workshop instructions. Simplify all the
workshop_setup.csh scripts to do the minimal work needed by the DART
tutorial.</LI>
<LI>Updates to the models/template directory with the start of a full 3d
geophysical model template. Still under construction.</LI>
<LI>Move the pdf files in the tutorial directory up a level.  Removed
framemaker source files because we no longer have access to a working
version of the Framemaker software.  Moved routines that generate figures
and diagrams to a non-distributed directory of the subversion repository.</LI>
<LI>Enable netCDF large file support in the work/input.nml for models which
are likely to have large state vectors.</LI>
<LI>Minor updates to the doc.css file, make pages look identical in the
safari and firefox browsers.</LI>
<LI>Added a utility that sorts and reformats namelists, culls all comments to
the bottom of the file. Useful for doing diffs and finding duplicated
namelists in a file.</LI>
<LI>Cleaned up mkmf files - removed files for obsolete platforms and
compilers, updated suggested default flags for intel.</LI>
<LI>Update the mkmf template for gfortran to allow fortran source lines
longer than 132 characters.</LI>
</UL>
