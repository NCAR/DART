<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>The DART software provides a flexible, extensible framework for
conducting data assimilation research on a wide variety of models
and observations. In order to facilitate the incorporation of new
models, which in the Geoscience community are frequently written in
Fortran 90, the DART software is written primarily in Fortran 90.
Control scripts are primarily in C Shell, and the distribution
includes MatlabÂ® diagnostic scripts.</p>
<p>The DART system comes with many models -- ranging from
1-dimensional Lorenz systems to full global atmospheric and ocean
models. DART also has extensive tutorial materials that explain
typical DART experiments and explores many aspects of ensemble data
assimilation. <a href="#download">Download the DART source code</a>
and see the <a href="Lanai_release.html">release notes</a> for
instructions on how to build an executable, run the "workshop"
experiments, and look at the results. The <em class=
"file">DART_LAB</em> directory contains presentation slides and
interactive MATLAB demonstrations which illustrate and explain the
fundamentals of the ensemble data assimilation algorithms. The
<em class="file">tutorial</em> directory contains a series of PDF
files which go into more mathematical detail on various ensemble
data assimilation topics, and specifics on the DART
implementation.</p>
<a name="requirements" id="requirements"></a>
<h2>DART requirements</h2>
<p>DART is intended to be highly portable but has a strong
Unix/Linux preference. DART has been run successfully on Windows
machines under the cygwin environment. Those instructions are under
development - if you would like to be a friendly beta-tester please
send me (Tim Hoar) an email and I'll send you the instructions, as
long as you promise to provide feedback (good or bad!) so I can
improve them. My email
is   thoar @ ucar . edu - minus
the spaces, naturally.<br>
<br>
Minimally, you will need a Fortran90 compiler and the netCDF
libraries built with the F90 interface. History has shown that it
is a very good idea to make sure your run-time environment has the
following:</p>
<div class="unix">limit stacksize unlimited<br>
limit datasize unlimited</div>
<p>If you want to run your own model, all you need is an executable
and some scripts to interface with DART - we have templates and
examples. If your model can be called as a subroutine, <em>life is
good</em>, and the hardest part is usually a routine to parse the
model state vector into one whopping array - and back. Again - we
have templates, examples, and a document describing the required
interfaces. That document exists in the DART code -
<code>DART/models/model_mod.html</code> - as does all the most
current documentation. Almost every DART program/module has a
matching piece of documentation.<br>
<br>
Starting with the Jamaica release there is an option to compile
with the MPI (Message Passing Interface) libraries in order to run
the assimilation step in parallel on hardware with multiple CPUs.
Note that this is optional; MPI is not required to run DART. If you
do want to run in parallel then we also require a working MPI
library and appropriate cluster or SMP hardware. See the <a href=
"mpi_intro.html">MPI intro</a> for more information on running
with the MPI option.<br>
<br>
One of the beauties of ensemble data assimilation is that even if
(particularly if) your model is single-threaded, you can still run
efficiently on parallel machines by dealing out each ensemble
member (an unique instance of the model) to a separate processor.
If your model cannot run single-threaded, fear not, DART can do
that too.</p>
<h2>DART platforms/compilers/batch systems</h2>
<p>We work to keep the DART code highly portable. We avoid
compiler-specific constructs, require no system-specific functions,
and try as much as possible to be easy to build on new
platforms.</p>
<p>DART has been compiled and run on Apple laptops and
workstations, Linux clusters small and large, SGI Altix systems,
IBM Power systems, IBM Intel systems, Cray systems.</p>
<p>DART has been compiled with compilers from Intel, PGI, Cray,
GNU, IBM, Pathscale.</p>
<p>MPI versions of DART have run under batch systems including LSF,
PBS, Moab/Torque, and Sun Grid Engine.</p>
<p>We have run successfully on a Windows machine under the
<code>cygwin</code> environment. If you are interested in this,
please <a href="mailto:dart@ucar.edu">contact us</a>.</p>

<a name="download" id="download"></a> <a name="distributions" id=
"distributions"></a>
<h1>DART code distributions</h1>
<p>The DART code is distributed via a Subversion (<b>SVN</b>)
repository. Anonymous access is allowed, and the repository code is
read-only for everyone except the DART development team. DART is
distributed as source code, so you must be prepared to build the
parts of the system you need before you can run it.</p>
<p>Using subversion makes it easy to update and compare your
checked-out version of the code with the latest repository version
of the code. If you are not familiar with the <em class=
"code">svn</em> command (the client application of subversion), you
should take a stroll through Tim's <a href=
"http://www.image.ucar.edu/~thoar/svn_primer.html">svn primer</a>.
Or there are several GUI programs that help you manage, check out,
and merge subversion distributions. If you cannot use <em class=
"code">svn</em> (e.g. because you are behind a firewall that does
not permit subversion access), please <a href=
"mailto:dart@ucar.edu">email the DART team</a> and we may be able
to send you a tar file as a last resort.</p>
<p>The DART development team keeps released versions of the code
which are stable (don't change) except for bug fixes. Generally we
recommend users check out one of these versions. The DART
development team makes frequent updates to the trunk version of the
code as new features are developed. Those users who want to use
recently added features are welcome to check out the trunk, but
they should be prepared to work around possible non-backwards
compatible changes and more lightly tested code than the released
versions.</p>
<p>DART continues to evolve. We request that you register using
<a href="/DAReS/DART/DART_download">this web page</a> and
afterwards you will be redirected to instructions on how to
download a version of the DART code. Registration helps us track
how many people are using our code, and allows us to contact
current users in case of bugs or major updates. The DART mailing
list is a <strong>very low-traffic</strong> list -- perhaps 4
emails per year -- so PLEASE use a real email address when signing
up. We solemnly swear to protect your email address like it is our
own! Even local NCAR users or users who have registered in the past
are encouraged to reregister when downloading new versions. Thank
you for your understanding.</p>

<h2>DART Tutorial Materials and Presentations</h2>
<p>The DART system comes with an extensive set of tutorial
materials, working models with several different levels of
complexity, and data to be assimilated. It has been used in several
multi-day workshops and can be used as the basis to teach a section
on Data Assimilation. <!--add refs to people doing this already-->
 Download the DART software distribution and look in the
<code>DART_LAB</code> subdirectory for pdf and powerpoint
presentations, and MATLAB GUI point-and-click examples and hands-on
demonstrations. Also look in the <code>tutorial</code> subdirectory
for pdf files for each of the 22 tutorial sections.<br>
<br>
<strong>Browsing the DART_LAB and tutorial directories in the
distribution is worth the effort. Doing the tutorials is even
better!</strong></p>
<h2>Presentations about DART</h2>

presentations themselves) and publications is available on our
