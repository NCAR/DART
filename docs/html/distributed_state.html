The key part of RMA DART is having a state that is physically distributed 
across processors.  The location in memory of any part of the state vector 
(which processor and where in memory on that processor) is completely under 
the control of filter, not model_mod.
<p>
Implications of this:
<ul>
<li> The model_mod never gets a whole state vector to use. So no whole vector 
     for a forward operator, and no whole vector for the mean.
<li> The model_mod can not make any assumptions about the order of elements in 
     the state.
<br> Currently, filter is ordering variables in the order they are listed in 
     add_domain and with the dimenion order of the netcdf file. This is what 
     is happening in most model_mod converters (model_to_dart, dart_to_model).  
     However CAM and bgrid_solo rearrange the state in Lanai. These model_mods 
     (and converters) have been changed to not rearrage the state.
</ul>

So, how does the model_mod access the state without having the vector and not 
knowing the state order?  - state accessor routines.

<h4> State Accessor Routines </h4>

<h5> Getting the dart index </h5>
<P.
<code>function get_dart_vector_index(i, j, k, dom_id, var_id)</code>
<p>
get_dart_vector_index returns the dart index for a given i,j,k of a variable.
Note if the variable is 1D j and k are ignored. If a variable is 2D k is 
ignored. Note only variables upto 3D are supported, but this could be extended 
to support upto 7 dimensional variables (or whatever fortran and netcdf will 
support).

<h5> Getting the state at a given dart index </h5>

<code>function x = get_state(index, state_handle)</code>
<p>
get_state returns the state x at the given index. state_handle is a derived 
type which conatins the state information.  state_handle is passed to the 
model_mod from above. get_state returns an array of values (the whole ensemble 
at index) during model_mod and a single value (the mean) during get_close_obs 
or vert_convert.
<p>
If you have an array of indices, for example a forward operator which is 
located in different levels on different ensemble members you can use 
get_state_array. An example of this is in CAM when an observation is in 
pressure, the level an observation is in depends on the state and so can vary 
across the ensemble.
<p>
<code>subroutine get_state_array(x(:), index(:), state_handle)</code>
<p>
The code inside get_state_array will do the minimum amount of communication to 
get you the indices you need.  For example if
<p>&nbsp; index = [ 3 4 3 3 4 3]
<p>get_state_array will only do 2 mpi communications and return
<p>&nbsp;  x = [state(3), state(4), state(3), state(3), state(4), state(3)]
<p>

A limited module diagram is shown below. A -> B means A uses B:

Filter_mod and assim_tools_mod take care of making data available for use with 
get_state. Note get_state will only return data during 
<em> model_interpolate</em>, <em>get_close_obs</em>, or <em>vert_convert</em>. 
If you use get_state outside these routines you will get and error.
<p>
<b> Compliation Notes </b>
<p>
The Remote Memory Access programming model we are using uses mpi_windows. 
There are 2 ways to compile window mods for mpi and non-mpi filter. This
is taken care of automatically when you run quickbuild.csh or an mkmf_* with 
-mpi or -nompi. However, if you use mpi, there is a choice of mpi_window mods:
<ul>
<li> cray_win_mod.f90
<li> no_cray_win_mod.f90
</ul>

<p>
We have these two modules that you can swap in your path_names files because 
the MPI 2 standard states:<br>
Implementors may restrict the use of RMA communication that is synchronized by 
lock calls to windows in memory allocated by MPI_ALLOC_MEM.<br> 
MPI_ALLOC_MEM uses cray pointers, thus we have supplied a window module that 
uses cray pointers.  However, no_cray_win_mod.f90 is the default since some 
versions of gfortran (4.9.0) do not support cray pointers.  These different 
modules will go away when we swap to MPI 3.
