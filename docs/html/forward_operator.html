In Lanai the forward operator is performed by the first ens_size processors. This was because access to the whole state vector is required for the forward operator, and only the first ens_size processors had the whole state vector. The distributed state forward operator has a diffent loop structure to Lanai because all processors can do the foward operator for their observations.

<ul>
<li>Lanai: the first ens_size processors loop around ALL OBSERVATIONS.</li>
<li>Distributed state: ALL PROCESSORS loop around observations/num_procs.</li>
</ul>
<p>

The forward operator is performed in <code>get_obs_ens_distrb_state</code>.  A limited call tree for <code>get_obs_ens_distrb_state</code> is shown below.

The QC_LOOP is in <code>get_obs_ens_distrb_state</code> because the qc across the ensemble is known. This removes the need for a transpose of the forward_op_ens_handle. Note this is different from Lanai.

The window opening and closing in <code>get_obs_ens_distrb_state</code> is as follows:

<ol>
<li>State window created (processors can access other processor's memory)</li>
<li>Forward operator called</li>
<li>QC calculated</li>
<li>State window destroyed (processors can no longer access other processor's memory)</li>
</ol>


<p>
However, there may be occasions where having only the first ens_size processors
perform the forward operator. For example, if the forward operator is being read from a file, or the forward operator uses a large portion of the state. Or when
debugging it may be easier to have 1 task per ensemble member.
<p>

To transpose and do the forward operators like Lanai, you can use the filter_nml
namelist option distribute_state = .false. The process is the same as above except
the window creation and destruction are transposing the state.

<ol>
<li>State window created (state ensemble is transposed var complete)</li>
<li>Forward operator called</li>
<li>QC calculated</li>
<li>State window destroyed (state ensemble is tranaposed to copy complete)</li>
</ol>

Note, that if you have fewer tasks than ensemble members some tasks will still be doing vectorized forward operators (because they own more than one ensemble member).

<h2> State Access </h2>


Model_mod routines no longer get an array containing the state.  The state is accessed through the function <code>get_state</code>.
<p>
<code>
x = get_state(i, state_handle)
</code>
<p>
where x is the state at index i. <code>state_handle</code> is passed from above.
During model_interpolate <code>get_state</code> returns an array.  Durring <code>get_state</code> returns a single value (the mean state).
