In the RMA version of DART, the state vector is not required to be stored 
completely on any process. This is achieved using Remote Memory Access (RMA).  
The RMA programing model allows processes to read (and write) memory on other 
processors asynchronously.

RMA DART supported models:
<ul>
<li> 9var
<li> bgrid_solo
<li> cam-fv
<li> cice
<li> cm1
<li> lorenz_04
<li> lorenz_63
<li> lorenz_84
<li> lorenz_96
<li> mpas_atm (NetCDF overwrite not supported for update_u_from_reconstruct = .true. )
<li> POP
<li> ROMS
<li> wrf
</ul>

There are six major differences between Lanai and RMA DART:
<ul>
<li> Read and write NetCDF restarts
<li> Calculation of forward operators
<li> Vertical conversion of observation locations
<li> Diagnostic file changes
<li> <a href="state_structure.html">State structure module </a>
<li> Perturbation of the state
</ul>

<p> Before bitwise testing with Lanai please read 
<a href="bitwise_considerations.html">bitwise considerations</a>

<h4> NetCDF Restarts </h4>

The programs filter and perfect_model_obs now read/write directly from NetCDF 
files, rather than having to run converters (<code>model_to_dart</code> and 
<code>dart_to_model</code>).

To facilitate this, there is a new required call <code>add_domain</code> 
which must be called during <code>static_init_model</code>.  It can be called 
multiple times in static_model_mod, e.g. once for each NetCDF file that 
contains state variables.  There are three ways to add a domain:

<ul>
<li> <b>From Blank</b> : This is for small models such as lorenz_96 and no NetCDF restarts
   <ul>
   <li> <code>dom_id = add_domain(model_size)</code>
   </ul>
<li> <b>From File</b> : This is for models which have NetCDF restart files
   <ul>
   <li> <code>dom_id = add_domain(template_file, num_vars, var_names, ... )</code>
   </ul>
<li> <b>From Spec</b> : Creates a skeleton structure for a domain ( currently only used in 
                 bgrid_solo )
   <ul>
   <li> <code>dom_id = add_domain(num_vars, var_names, ... )</code><br>
        <code>call add_dimension_to_variable(dom_id, var_id, dim_nam, dim_size)</code> <br>
        <code>call finished_adding_domain</code>
   </ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
For models without NetCDF restarts, use <code>add_domain(model_size)</code>. 
This is the minimum amount of information needed by DART to create a netdcf 
file.  For models with NetCDF restarts use 
<code>add_domain(info_file, num_vars, var_names)</code> which lets DART read 
the NetCDF dimensions for a list of variables from a file 
(<code>info_file</code>). There are several routines that can be used together 
to create a domain from a description:
<code>add_domain, add_dimension_to_variable, finished_adding_domain</code>. 
This can be used in models such as bgrid_solo where the model is spun up in 
perfect_model_obs, but the model itself has variable structure 
(3D variables with names).

See <a href="#namelist_changes">Additions/Changes to existing namelists for how to use NetCDF IO</a>.

<p>
<b>Note</b> when using NetCDF restarts, inflation files are NetCDF also. 
The inflation mean and inflation standard deviation are in separate files 
when you use NetCDF restarts. See <a href="netcdf_inflation_files.html">NetCDF inflation files</a> for details.


<p>
<h4> Calculation of forward operators</h4>
The forward operator code in model_mod now operates on an array of state 
values. See <a href="forward_operator.html">forward operator</a> for more 
detail about distributed vs. non-distributed forward operators.

In distributed mode the forward operators for all ensemble members are
calculated in the same <code>model_interpolate</code> call.  In non-distributed
mode, the forward oeprators for all ensemble members a task owns (1-ens_size) 
are calculated at once.
<p>

<h4> Vertical conversion of observation locations </h4>
The vertical conversion of observation locations is done before the 
assimilation. In Lanai this calculation is done in the assimilation as part
of <code>get_close_obs</code> if a model_mod does vertical conversion. See 
<a href="vertical_conversion.html">vertical conversion</a> for details about 
this change.  Note that not all models do vertical conversion or even have a 
concept of vertical location, but every model_mod must have the following 
routines:

<ul>
<li>
<code>query_vert_localization_coord</code> - returns the vertical localization 
coordiate (or does nothing if there is no vertical conversion)
<li>
<code>vert_convert</code> - converts location to required vertical (or does 
nothing if there is no vertical conversion)
</ul>
<p>

<p>
<h4> Diagnostic file changes </h4>
For large models DART format diagnostic files (Prior_Diag.nc and 
Posterior_Diag.nc) have been replaced with separate files for each copy that would 
have gone into Prior_Diag.nc and Posterior_Diag.nc.
<p>

For Prior_Diag.nc:

<ul>
<li><b>Mean and standard deviation</b>:
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;preassim_mean.nc
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;preassim_sd.nc
<li><b>Inflation mean and standard deviation</b> (if state space inflation is used):
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;preassim_priorinf_mean.nc
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;preassim_priorinf_sd.nc
<li><b>The number of ensemble members specifed</b> in filter_nml (num_output_state_members):
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;preassim_member_####.nc
</ul>

<p>

For Posterior_Diag.nc:

<ul>
<li><b>Mean and standard deviation</b>:
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;postassim_mean.nc
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;postassim_sd.nc
<li><b>Inflation mean and standard deviation</b> (if state space inflation is used):
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;postassim_priorinf_mean.nc
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;postassim_priorinf_sd.nc
<li><b>The number of ensemble members specifed</b> in filter_nml (num_output_state_members):
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;postassim_member_####.nc
</ul>
<p>

The <code>num_output_state_members</code> are not written separately from the restarts. 
Note that restarts will have been clamped if any clamping is applied (given 
as an arguement to add_domain). This is <em>different</em> to Posterior_Diag.nc
which contains unclamped values.
Note also that there are 2 more 
<a href="#STAGES_TO_WRITE">"stages" </a>
which might be output, in addition to the preassim and postassim discussed here.

<p> For models with multiple domains the filenames above are appended with the 
domain number, e.g. preassim_mean.nc becomes preassim_mean_d01.nc, 
preassim_mean_d02.nc, etc.

<h5>Changes to nc_write_model_atts</h5>
<code>nc_write_model_atts</code> has an new argument 
'<code>model_mod_writes_state_variables</code>'. 
This is used to communicate to DART whether the model will create and write
state variables in Prior_Diag.nc and Posterior_Diag.nc.  If 
<code>model_model_writes_state_variables = .false.</code> 
DART will define and write state variables to the new diagnostic files.  If 
<code>model_model_writes_state_variables = .true.,  nc_write_model_vars</code> 
is called as normal.

<h4>Perturbations</h4>
The option to perturb one ensemble member to produce an ensemble is in 
filter_nml:<code>perturb_from_single_instance</code>. The model_mod interface 
is now <code>pert_model_copies</code> not <code>pert_model_state</code>. Each 
task perturbs every ensemble member for its own subsection of state.  This is 
more complicated than the Lanai routine <code>pert_model_state</code>, where a 
whole state vector is available. If a model_mod does not provide a perturb 
interface, filter will do the perturbing with an amplitude set in 
filter_nml:perturbation_amplitude. Note the perturb 
namelist options have been removed from ensemble_manager_nml

<h4>state_vector_io_nml</h4>

<P>
<div class=namelist>
<pre>
&amp;state_vector_io_nml
   buffer_state_io         = .false.,
   single_precision_output = .false.,
/
</pre>
</div>
<p>
When <code>buffer_state_io</code> is
<code>.false.</code> the entire state is read into memory at once
if .true. variables are read one at a time. 
If your model can not fit into memory at once this must 
be set to <code>.true.</code> . 
<p>
<code>single_precision_output</code> allows you to run filter in double precision but write 
NetCDF files in single precision.

    <TD>True means that all of the restart and inflation information is read from
        a single NetCDF file.  False means that you must specify an input_state_file_list

    <TD>True means that all of the restart and inflation information is written to

<TR><TD>write_all_stages_at_end</TD>
    <TD>logical</TD>
    <TD>True means output all stages at the end of filter.  This is more memory

        the overall cost of the assimilation, so writting all stages at the end writes

In previous DART releases, each processor gets a copy of the mean 
(in ens_mean_for_model).  In RMA DART, the mean is distributed across all 
processors.  However, a user can choose to have a copy of the mean on each 
processor by setting <code>distribute_mean = .false.</code> .  Note that the 
mean state is accessed through <code>get_state</code> whether distribute_mean 
is <code>.true.</code> or <code>.false.</code>
