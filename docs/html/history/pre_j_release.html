<A NAME="OVERVIEW"></A>
<H1>Overview of DART</H1>

<P>The Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) is designed to 
facilitate the combination of assimilation algorithms, models, 
and observation sets to allow increased understanding of all three. 
The DART programs have been compiled with several Fortran 90 compilers 
and run on a linux compute-server and linux clusters. 
You should definitely read the 
<A HREF="#customizations">Customizations</A> section.<BR><BR>

DART employs a modular programming approach to apply an Ensemble Kalman Filter
which nudges models toward a state that is more consistent with information 
from a set of observations. Models may be swapped in and out, as can 
different algorithms in the Ensemble Kalman Filter. The method 
requires running multiple instances of a model to generate an ensemble of 
states. A forward operator appropriate for the type of observation being used is
applied to each of the states to generate the model's estimate of the observation.
Comparing these estimates and their uncertainty to the observation and 
its uncertainty ultimately results in the adjustments to the model states. 
Sort of. There's more to it, described in detail in the tutorial directory 
of the package.<BR><BR>

DART ultimately creates a few netCDF files containing the model states just before 
the adjustment <em class=file>Prior_Diag.nc</em> and just after the adjustment 
<em class=file>Posterior_Diag.nc</em> as well as a file 
<em class=file>obs_seq.final</em> with the model estimates of the observations.
There is a suite of Matlab&#174; functions that facilitate exploration of the
results.
</P>

<P>
<A HREF="/DAReS/DART/DART_download">The "pre_j" distribution.</A>
</P>

<P>The <b>pre_j</b> release provides several new models and has a greatly expanded capability for 
<b>real</b> observations which required a fundamentally
different implementation of the low-level routines. It is now required to run a
preprocessor on several of the program units to construct the source code files
which will be compiled by the remaining units. Due to the potentially large number
of observations types possible and for portability reasons, the preprocessor
is actually a F90 program that uses the namelist mechanism for specifying the
observation types to be included. This also prevents having a gory set of 
compile flags that is different for every compiler. 
One very clever colleague also 'built a better mousetrap' and figured out 
how to effectively and robustly read namelists, detect errors, and 
generate meaningful error messages. HURRAY!
</P>

<P>
The pre_j release has also been tested with more compilers in an attempt to 
determine non-portable code elements. It is my experience that the largest
impediment to portable code is the reliance on the compiler to autopromote
<TT>real</TT> variables to one flavor or another. 
<A HREF="/DART/PrecisionNotes.html">Different compilers perform this autopromotion in different ways.</A>
Using the F90 "kind" allows for much more flexible code, in that the use
of interface procedures is possible only when two routines do not have identical
sets of input arguments -- something that happens when the compiler autopromotes 
32bit reals to 64bit reals, for example.
</P>

<P>DART programs can require three different types of input. 
First, some of the DART programs, those for creating synthetic
observational datasets, require interactive input from the keyboard. 
For simple cases, this interactive input can be made directly 
from the keyboard. In more complicated cases, a file containing 
the appropriate keyboard input can be created and this file 
can be directed to the standard input of the DART program. 
Second, many DART programs expect one or more input files in 
DART specific formats to be available. For instance, 
<em class=program>perfect_model_obs</em>, which creates a synthetic 
observation set given a particular model and a description 
of a sequence of observations, requires an input file that 
describes this observation sequence.
At present, the observation files for DART are in a custom format in either 
human-readable ascii or more compact machine-specific binary. Third, many DART 
modules (including main programs) make use of the Fortan90 
namelist facility to obtain values of certain parameters 
at run-time. All programs look for a namelist input file 
called <em class=file>input.nml</em> in the directory in which 
the program is executed. The <em class=file>input.nml</em> 
file can contain a sequence of individual Fortran90 namelists 
which specify values of particular parameters for modules that 
compose the executable program.
DART provides a mechanism that automatically 
generates namelists with the default values for each program to be run.  
</P>

<P>
DART uses the 
<A HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/">netCDF</A> 
self-describing data format with a particular metadata convention to 
describe output that is used to analyze the results of assimilation 
experiments.  These files have the extension <em class=file>.nc</em> 
and can be read by a number of standard data analysis tools. 
A set of <A HREF="http://www.mathworks.com/">Matlab</A>
scripts, designed to produce graphical diagnostics from DART netCDF 
output files are available.
DART users have also used <A HREF="http://meteora.ucsd.edu/~pierce/ncview_home_page.html">ncview</A> 
to create rudimentary graphical displays of output data fields. 
The <A HREF="http://nco.sourceforge.net">NCO</A> tools, produced by 
UCAR's Unidata group, are available to do operations like 
concatenating, slicing, and dicing of netCDF files.

<P>
This document outlines the installation of the DART software
and the system requirements. For convenience, some of the original 
colloquium exercises are repeated here, mostly just to check the
installation. A few of the 
<A HREF="/DART/dart_exercise_doc.pdf">exercises from the ASP summer 2003 Colloquium</A>
are repeated here, primarily to serve as the verification of the installation.
The entire installation process is summarized in

<P>
We have tried to make the code as portable as possible, but we
do not have access to all compilers on all platforms, so there are no
guarantees. We are interested in your experience building the system,
so please email me (Tim Hoar) thoar&nbsp;'at'&nbsp;ucar&nbsp;'dot'&nbsp;edu

<A NAME="compilers"></A>
<HR>
<H2>Requirements: an F90 Compiler</H2>

<P>
The DART software has been successfully built on several Linux/x86
platforms with several versions of the 
<A HREF="http://www.intel.com/software/products/compilers/flin">Intel Fortran
Compiler for Linux</A>, which (at one point) is/was free for individual 
scientific use. 
It has also been built and successfully run with several 
versions of each of the following:
<A HREF="http://www.pgroup.com">Portland Group Fortran Compiler</A>, 
<A HREF="http://www.lahey.com">Lahey Fortran Compiler</A>, 
<A HREF="http://www.pathscale.com">Pathscale Fortran Compiler</A>, 
<A HREF="http://www.absoft.com">Absoft Fortran 90/95 Compiler (Mac OSX)</A>. 
Since recompiling the code is a necessity to experiment
with different models, there are no binaries to distribute.
</P>

<!--==================================================================-->

<A NAME="netCDFlib"></A>
<HR>
<H2>Requirements: the <em class=file>netCDF</em> library</H2>

<P>
DART uses the 
<A HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/">netCDF</A> 
self-describing data format for the results of assimilation 
experiments. These files have the extension <em class=file>.nc</em> 
and can be read by a number of standard data analysis tools. 
In particular, DART also makes use of the F90 interface to the library
which is available through the <em class=file>netcdf.mod</em> and
<em class=file>typesizes.mod</em> modules. 
<em class=bold>IMPORTANT</em>: different compilers create these modules with
different "case" filenames, and sometimes they are not <strong>both</strong>
installed into the expected directory. It is required that both modules
be present. The normal place would be in the <TT>netcdf/include</TT> 
directory, as opposed to the  <TT>netcdf/lib</TT> directory.
</P>

<P>
If the netCDF library does not exist on your system, you must build
it (as well as the F90 interface modules). The library and instructions 
for building the library or installing from an RPM may be found at 
the netCDF home page: 
<A HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/">
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/</A> 
Pay particular attention to the compiler-specific patches that must 
be applied for the Intel Fortran Compiler. (Or the PG compiler, for
that matter.)
</P>

<P>
The location of the netCDF library, <em class=file>libnetcdf.a</em>,
and the locations of both <em class=file>netcdf.mod</em> and
<em class=file>typesizes.mod</em> will be needed by the makefile
template, as described in the <A HREF="#compiling">compiling</A>
section.
</P>

<!--==================================================================-->

<A NAME="download"></A>
<HR>
<H2>Unpacking the distribution.</H2>

<P>
The DART source code is distributed as a compressed tar file 
<A HREF="/DAReS/DART/DART_download">from our download site</A>.
When gunzip'ed and untarred, the source tree will begin with a 
directory named <em class=file>DART</em> and will be approximately 
189 Mb. Compiling the code in this tree (as is usually the case) will
necessitate much more space.
</P>

<div class=unix>
   gunzip <em class=file>DART_pre_j.tar.gz</em><BR>
   tar -xvf <em class=file>DART_pre_j.tar</em><BR>
</div>

<P>
The code tree is very "bushy"; there are many directories of support
routines, etc. but only a few directories involved with the
customization and installation of the DART software. If you can
compile and run ONE of the low-order models, you should be able to
compile and run ANY of the low-order models. For this reason,
we can focus on the Lorenz `63 model. Subsequently, the only
directories with files to be modified to check the installation 
are:
&nbsp;<em class=file>DART/mkmf</em>,
&nbsp;<em class=file>DART/models/lorenz_63/work</em>, and 
&nbsp;<em class=file>DART/matlab</em> (but only for analysis).
</P>

<!--==================================================================-->

<A NAME="customizations"></A>
<HR>
<H2>Customizing the build scripts -- Overview.</H2>

<P>
DART executable programs are constructed using two tools: 
<em class=program>make</em> and 
<em class=program>mkmf</em>. 
The <em class=program>make</em> utility is a relatively common
piece of software that requires a user-defined input file that records 
dependencies between different source files. <em class=program>make</em> 
then performs a hierarchy of actions when one or more of the
source files is modified. The <em class=program>mkmf</em> utility is 
a custom preprocessor that generates a <em class=program>make</em> input file 
(named <em class=file>Makefile</em>) and an example namelist 
<em class=file>input.nml.<em class=program><i>program</i>_default</em></em>
with the default values. The <em class=file>Makefile</em> is designed specifically to work
with object-oriented Fortran90 (and other languages) for systems like DART.
</P>

<P>
<em class=program>mkmf</em> requires two separate input files. 
The first is a `template' file which specifies details of the commands 
required for a specific Fortran90 compiler and may also contain 
pointers to directories containing pre-compiled utilities required by 
the DART system. <strong>This template file will need to 
be modified to reflect your system</strong>. The second input file is a 
`path_names' file which includes a complete list of the locations 
(either relative or absolute) of all Fortran90 source files that are 
required to produce a particular DART program. 
Each 'path_names' file must contain a path for 
exactly one Fortran90 file containing a main program, 
but may contain any number of additional paths pointing to files 
containing Fortran90 modules. 
An <em class=program>mkmf</em> command is executed which 
uses the 'path_names' file and the mkmf template file to produce a 
<em class=file>Makefile</em> which is subsequently used by the
standard <em class=program>make</em> utility.
</P>

<P>
Shell scripts that execute the mkmf command for all standard 
DART executables are provided as part of the standard DART software. 
For more information on <em class=program>mkmf</em> see 
<A HREF="http://www.gfdl.gov/fms/pubrel/j/atm_dycores/doc/dycore_public_manual.html#mkmf">the FMS mkmf description</A>.
<BR>
One of the benefits of using <em class=program>mkmf</em> is that it also 
creates an example namelist file for each program. The example namelist is 
called 
<em class=file>input.nml.<em class=program><i>program</i>_default</em></em>, 
so as not to clash with any 
exising <em class=file>input.nml</em> that may exist in that directory.
</P>

<A NAME="template"></A>
<H3 class=indent1>Building and Customizing the 'mkmf.template' file</H3>

<P>
A series of templates for different compilers/architectures exists 
in the <em class=file>DART/mkmf/</em> directory and have names with
extensions that identify either the compiler, the architecture, or both. 
This is how you inform the build process of the specifics of your system. 
Our intent is that you copy one that is similar to your system into 
<em class=file>mkmf.template</em> and customize it.
For the discussion that follows, knowledge of the contents of one of these
templates (i.e. <em class=file>mkmf.template.pgf90.ghotiol</em>) is needed: 
(note that only the LAST lines are shown here, 
the head of the file is just a big comment)
</P>

<div class=routine>
# Makefile template for PGI f90<BR>
FC = pgf90<BR>
LD = pgf90<BR>
CPPFLAGS =<BR>
LIST = -Mlist<BR>
NETCDF = /contrib/netcdf-3.5.1-cc-c++-pgif90.5.2-4<BR>

LIBS = -L$(NETCDF)/lib -lnetcdf<BR>
LDFLAGS = $(LIBS)<BR>
<BR>
...<BR>
</div>

<P>
Essentially, each of the lines defines some part of the resulting 
<em class=file>Makefile</em>. Since <em class=program>make</em>
is particularly good at sorting out dependencies, the order of these 
lines really doesn't make any difference.
The <em class=code>FC = pgf90</em> line ultimately defines the 
Fortran90 compiler to use, etc.
The lines which are most likely to need site-specific changes 
start with <em class=code>FFLAGS</em> and <em class=code>NETCDF</em>, which 
indicate where to look for the netCDF F90 modules and the 
location of the netCDF library and modules.
</P>

<A HREF="netCDF"></A>
<H4 class=indent2>NETCDF</H4>

<P class=indent1>
Modifying the <em class=code>NETCDF</em> value should be relatively
straightforward.<BR>
Change the string to reflect the location of your netCDF installation 
containing <em class=file>netcdf.mod</em> and
<em class=file>typesizes.mod</em>.
The value of the <em class=code>NETCDF</em> variable will be used by 
the <em class=code>FFLAGS, LIBS,</em> and <em class=code>LDFLAGS</em> 
variables.<BR>
</P>


<A HREF="fflags"></A>
<H4 class=indent2>FFLAGS</H4>

<P class=indent1>
Each compiler has different compile flags, so there is really no way
to exhaustively cover this other than to say the templates as we supply
them should work -- depending on the location of your netCDF.
The low-order models can be compiled without a <em class=code>-r8</em> 
switch, but the <em class=file>bgrid_solo</em> model cannot. 
</P>

<A NAME="path_names"></A>
<H3 class=indent1>Customizing the 'path_names_*' file</H3>

<P>
Several <em class=file>path_names_*</em> files are provided in

in this case: <em class=file>DART/models/lorenz_63/work</em>.

<P>
There are six <em class=file>mkmf_</em><em class=italic>xxxxxx</em> 
files for the programs 
<em class=program>preprocess</em>, 
<em class=program>create_obs_sequence</em>, 
<em class=program>create_fixed_network_seq</em>, 
<em class=program>perfect_model_obs</em>,
<em class=program>filter</em>, and 
<em class=program>obs_diag</em> along with the 
corresponding <em class=file>path_names_</em><em class=italic>xxxxxx</em> files.
You can examine the contents of one of the 
<em class=file>path_names_</em><em class=italic>xxxxxx</em> files, 
for instance <em class=file>path_names_filter</em>, to see a list of 
the relative paths of all files that contain Fortran90 modules 
required for the program <em class=program>filter</em> for 
the L63 model. All of these paths are relative to your 
<em class=file>DART</em> directory.
The first path is the main program 
(<em class=file>filter.f90</em>) and is followed by all 
the Fortran90 modules used by this program (after preprocessing).
</P>

<P>
The <em class=program>mkmf_</em><em class=italic>xxxxxx</em> scripts 
are cryptic but should not need to be modified -- as long as you do not
restructure the code tree (by moving directories, for example).
The only function of the <em class=program>mkmf_</em><em class=italic>xxxxxx</em> 
script is to generate a <em class=file>Makefile</em> and an 
<em class=file>input.nml.<em class=program><i>program</i>_default</em></em>
file.  It is not supposed to compile anything:
</P>

<div class=unix>
csh mkmf_preprocess<BR>
make
</div>

<P>
The first command generates an appropriate <em class=file>Makefile</em> and
the <em class=file>input.nml.preprocess_default</em> file. 
The second command results in the compilation of a series of 
Fortran90 modules which ultimately produces an executable file: 
<em class=program>preprocess</em>.
Should you need to make any changes to the 
<em class=file>DART/mkmf/mkmf.template</em>, 
you will need to regenerate the <em class=file>Makefile</em>.  
<BR><BR>
The <em class=program>preprocess</em> program actually builds source code to
be used by all the remaining modules. It is <strong>imperative</strong> to
actually <strong>run</strong> <em class=program>preprocess</em> before building
the remaining executables. This is how the same code can assimilate state 
vector 'observations' for the Lorenz_63 model and real radar reflectivities for WRF 
without needing to specify a set of radar operators for the Lorenz_63 model!
<BR><BR>
<em class=program>preprocess</em> reads the <em class=code>&amp;preprocess_nml</em>
namelist to determine what observations and operators to incorporate. For this exercise, we will use the values in <em class=file>input.nml</em>.
<em class=program>preprocess</em> is designed to abort if
the files it is supposed to build already exist. For this reason, it is necessary
to remove a couple files (if they exist) before you run the preprocessor.
It is just a good habit to develop.  
</P>

<div class=unix>
\rm -f ../../../obs_def/obs_def_mod.f90<BR>
\rm -f ../../../obs_kind/obs_kind_mod.f90<BR>

ls -l ../../../obs_def/obs_def_mod.f90<BR>
ls -l ../../../obs_kind/obs_kind_mod.f90<BR>
</div>

<P>
This created <em class=file>../../../obs_def/obs_def_mod.f90</em> from
<em class=file>../../../obs_kind/DEFAULT_obs_kind_mod.F90</em> and several other
modules. <em class=file>../../../obs_kind/obs_kind_mod.f90</em> was created similarly.
Now we can build the rest of the project.
<BR><BR>
A series of object files for each module compiled will also be 
left in the work directory, as some of these are undoubtedly needed by the build
of the other DART components.
You can proceed to create the other five programs needed to work with 
L63 in DART as follows:
</P>

<div class=unix>
csh mkmf_create_obs_sequence<BR>
make<BR>
csh mkmf_create_fixed_network_seq<BR>

csh mkmf_perfect_model_obs<BR>
make<BR>
csh mkmf_filter<BR>
make<BR>
csh mkmf_obs_diag<BR>
make
</div><BR>

<P>
The result (hopefully) is that six executables now 
reside in your work directory. The most common problem is that the netCDF libraries
and include files (particularly <em class=file>typesizes.mod</em>) are not found. 
Edit the <em class=file>DART/mkmf/mkmf.template</em>,
recreate the <em class=file>Makefile</em>, and try again.

<HR>
<H2>Running Lorenz_63.</H2>

<P>
This initial sequence of exercises includes detailed instructions 
on how to work with the DART code and allows investigation of the 
basic features of one of the most famous dynamical systems, the 
3-variable Lorenz-63 model.
The remarkable complexity of this simple model will also be used as 
a case study to introduce a number of features of a simple ensemble 
filter data assimilation system. 
To perform a synthetic observation assimilation experiment 
for the L63 model, the following steps must be performed 
(an overview of the process is given first, 
followed by detailed procedures for each step):

   <LI><A HREF="#integrate">Integrate the L63 model for a long time</A><br>
   starting from arbitrary initial conditions to generate a model state 
   that lies on the attractor. The ergodic nature of the L63 system 
   means a 'lengthy' integration always converges to some point on 
   the computer's finite precision representation of the model's 
   attractor.<br><br></LI>

   <LI><A HREF="#ensemblate">Generate a set of ensemble initial conditions</A><br>

   ensemble members can be designed to look like random samples from 
   the model's 'climatological distribution'.  To generate an ensemble 
   member, very small perturbations can be introduced to the state on 
   the attractor generated by step 1. This perturbed state can then be 
   integrated for a very long time until all memory of its initial 
   condition can be viewed as forgotten. Any number of ensemble 
   initial conditions can be generated by repeating this procedure.<br><br></LI>

   <LI><A HREF="#generate">Populate the 'observation sequence' with 'perfect' observations</A><br>

   (a function that operates on the model state vector to produce 
   the expected value of the particular observation) and then adding 
   a random sample from the observation error distribution specified 
   in the observation set definition.  At the same time, diagnostic 
   output about the 'true' state trajectory can be created.<br><br></LI>

<A NAME="integrate"></A>
<H3 class=indent1>1. Integrate the L63 model for a 'long' time.</H3>
<em class=program>perfect_model_obs</em> integrates the model
for all the times specified in the 'observation sequence definition' file.
To this end, begin by creating an 'observation sequence definition' 
file that spans a long time. Creating an 'observation sequence definition' 
file is a two-step procedure involving 
<em class=program>create_obs_sequence</em> followed by 
<em class=program>create_fixed_network_seq</em>. After they are both run, it
is necessary to integrate the model with <em class=program>perfect_model_obs</em>.

<H4 class=indent1>1.1 Create an observation set definition.</H4>
<P>
<em class=program>create_obs_sequence</em> creates an observation 
set definition, the time-independent part of an observation sequence. 
An observation set definition file only contains the 
<em class=code>location, type,</em> 
and <em class=code>observational error characteristics</em> 
(normally just the diagonal observational error variance) 
for a related set of observations. There are no actual observations,
nor are there any times associated with the definition.
For spin-up, we are only interested in integrating the L63 model, 
not in generating any particular synthetic observations. 
Begin by creating a minimal observation set definition.<BR>
<BR> 
In general, for the low-order models, only a single observation set need
be defined. Next, the number of individual scalar observations 
(like a single surface pressure observation) in the set is needed. 
To spin-up an initial condition for the L63 model, only a  
single observation is needed. 
Next, the error variance for this observation must be entered. 
Since we do not need (nor want) this observation to have any impact 
on an assimilation (it will only be used for spinning up the model 
and the ensemble), enter a very large value for the error variance. 
An observation with a very large error variance has essentially no 
impact on deterministic filter assimilations like the default variety 
implemented in DART.  Finally, the location and type of the 
observation need to be defined.  For all types of models, 
the most elementary form of synthetic observations are called 
'identity' observations. These observations are generated simply 
by adding a random sample from a specified observational error 
distribution directly to the value of one of the state variables. 
This defines the observation as being an identity observation of the 
first state variable in the L63 model.
The program will respond by terminating after generating a file 
(generally named <em class=file>set_def.out</em>) 
that defines the single identity observation of the first 
state variable of the L63 model. The following is a screenshot 
(much of the verbose logging has been left off for clarity),
the user input looks <em class=input>like this</em>.

<P>
<em class=program>create_fixed_network_seq</em> creates an 'observation 
sequence definition' by extending the 'observation set definition'
with the temporal attributes of the observations.<BR>
<BR>
The first input is the name of the file created in the previous step, 
i.e. the name of the observation set definition that you've just created. 
It is possible to create sequences in which the observation sets 
are observed at regular intervals or irregularly in time. 
Here, all we need is a sequence that takes observations over a 
long period of time - indicated by entering a 1.
Although the L63 system normally is defined as having a non-dimensional 
time step, the DART system arbitrarily defines the model 
timestep as being 3600 seconds. 
If we declare that we have one observation per day for 1000 days, 
<!-- 
By declaring we have 1000 observations
taken once per day, --> we create an observation sequence definition 
spanning 24000 'model' timesteps; sufficient to spin-up the model 
onto the attractor. Finally, enter a name for the 
'observation sequence definition' file. Note again: there are no observation
values present in this file. Just an observation type, location, time and the
error characteristics. We are going to populate the observation sequence
with the <em class=program>perfect_model_obs</em> program.

<H4>1.3 Initialize the model onto the attractor.</H4>
<P>
   <em class=program>perfect_model_obs</em> can now advance the
   arbitrary initial state for 24,000 timesteps to move it onto the
   attractor.</BR>
   <em class=program>perfect_model_obs</em> uses the Fortran90 namelist 
   input mechanism instead of (admittedly gory, but temporary) interactive input.  
   All of the DART software expects the namelists to found in a file called 
   <em class=file>input.nml</em>. When you built the executable, 
   an example namelist was created 
   <em class=file>input.nml.perfect_model_obs_default</em>
   that contains all of the namelist input for the executable. 
   If you followed the example, each namelist was saved 
   to a unique name. We must now rename and edit the namelist file for 
   <em class=program>perfect_model_obs</em>. 
   Copy <em class=file>input.nml.perfect_model_obs_default</em>
   to <em class=file>input.nml</em> and edit it to look like the following:

<H3 class=indent1>2. Generate a set of ensemble initial conditions.</H3>

<P class=indent1>
   The set of initial conditions for a 'perfect model' experiment is 
   created in several steps.   1) Starting from the spun-up state of the model 
   (available in <em class=file>perfect_restart</em>),
   run <em class=program>perfect_model_obs</em> to generate
   the 'true state' of the experiment and a corresponding set of 
   observations. 2) Feed the same initial spun-up state 
   and resulting observations into <em class=program>filter</em>. 
   <BR><BR>
   The first step is achieved by changing a perfect_model_obs namelist parameter, 
   copying <em class=file>perfect_restart</em> to 
   <em class=file>perfect_ics</em>, and 
   rerunning <em class=program>perfect_model_obs</em>.
   This execution of <em class=program>perfect_model_obs</em> 
   will advance the model state from 
   the end of the first 24,000 steps to the end of an additional 24,000 
   steps and place the final state in <em class=file>perfect_restart</em>.
   The rest of the namelists in <em class=file>input.nml</em> should remain

   This step (#2 from above) is done with the program <em class=program>filter</em>, which also uses the 
   Fortran90 namelist mechanism for input. It is now necessary to copy the

   namelist in the input.nml does not hurt anything. In fact, I generally create a single
   <em class=file>input.nml</em> that has all the namelist blocks in it. 
   I simply copied the filter namelist block from 
   <em class=file>input.nml.filter_default</em> and inserted it into

   The filter is told to generate its own ensemble initial conditions 
   since <em class=code>start_from_restart</em> is '.false.'. 
   However, it is important to note that the filter still makes use of 
   <em class=file>perfect_ics</em> which is set to be the 
   <em class=code>restart_in_file_name</em>. 
   This is the model state generated from the first 24,000 step model 
   integration by <em class=program>perfect_model_obs</em>.
   <em class=program>Filter</em> generates its ensemble initial conditions 
   by randomly perturbing the state variables of this state.
</P> 

<P class=indent1>
The arguments <em class=code>output_state_ens_mean</em>
and <em class=code>output_state_ens_spread</em> are '.true.' so that 
these quantities are output at every time for which there are 
observations (once a day here) and 
<em class=code>num_output_ens_members</em> means that the same 
diagnostic files, 
<em class=file>Posterior_Diag.nc</em> and <em class=file>Prior_Diag.nc</em> 
also contain values for 20 ensemble members once a day. 
Once the namelist is set, execute <em class=program>filter</em> to 
integrate the ensemble forward for 24,000 steps with the final ensemble 
state written to the <em class=file>filter_restart</em>.
Copy the <em class=program>perfect_model_obs</em> restart file
<em class=file>perfect_restart</em> (the `true state') to 
<em class=file>perfect_ics</em>, and the
<em class=program>filter</em> restart file 
<em class=file>filter_restart</em> to 
<em class=file>filter_ics</em> so that future assimilation experiments 
can be initialized from these spun-up states.

<H2>Bias, filter divergence and covariance inflation (with the L63 model)</H2>

One of the common problems with ensemble filters is filter divergence, 
which can also be an issue with a variety of other flavors of filters 
including the classical Kalman filter. In filter divergence, 
the prior estimate of the model state becomes too confident, 
either by chance or because of errors in the forecast model, 
the observational error characteristics, or approximations 
in the filter itself.
If the filter is inappropriately confident that its prior estimate 
is correct, it will then tend to give less weight to observations 
than they should be given. 
The result can be enhanced overconfidence in the model's 
state estimate.
In severe cases, this can spiral out of control and the ensemble 
can wander entirely away from the truth, confident that it is 
correct in its estimate.
In less severe cases, the ensemble estimates may not diverge 
entirely from the truth but may still be too confident in their 
estimate.
The result is that the truth ends up being farther away from 
the filter estimates than the spread of the filter ensemble 
would estimate.
This type of behavior is commonly detected using rank histograms 
(also known as Talagrand diagrams).
You can see the rank histograms for the L63 initial assimilation 
by using the matlab script <em class=program>plot_bins</em>.  

<P>
A simple, but surprisingly effective way of dealing with filter 
divergence is known as covariance inflation.
In this method, the prior ensemble estimate of the state is 
expanded around its mean by a constant factor, effectively 
increasing the prior estimate of uncertainty while leaving the 
prior mean estimate unchanged.
The program <em class=program>filter</em> has a namelist 
parameter that controls the application of covariance inflation, 
<em class=code>cov_inflate</em>.
Up to this point, <em class=code>cov_inflate</em> has been set 
to 1.0 indicating that the prior ensemble is left unchanged.
Increasing <em class=code>cov_inflate</em> to values greater 
than 1.0 inflates the ensemble before assimilating observations 
at each time they are available.
Values smaller than 1.0 contract (reduce the spread) of prior 
ensembles before assimilating. 
</P>

<P>
You can do this by modifying the value of <em class=code>cov_inflate</em> 
in the namelist, (try 1.05 and 1.10 and other values at your discretion) 
and run the filter as above. 
In each case, use the diagnostic matlab tools to examine the 
resulting changes to the error, the ensemble spread 
(via rank histogram bins, too), etc.
What kind of relation between spread and error is seen in 
this model?
</P>


<!--==================================================================-->
<A NAME="syntheticobservations"></A>
<!--==================================================================-->
<HR>
<H2>Synthetic Observations</H2>
<P>Synthetic observations are generated from a `perfect' model integration, 
which is often referred to as the `truth' or a `nature run'. 
A model is integrated forward from some set of initial conditions and 
observations are generated as <em class=equation>y = H(x) + e</em>
where <em class=equation>H</em> is an operator on the model state 
vector, <em class=equation>x</em>, that gives the expected value of a 
set of observations, <em class=equation>y</em>, 
and <em class=equation>e</em> is a random variable with a distribution 
describing the error characteristics of the observing instrument(s) 
being simulated. 
Using synthetic observations in this way allows students to learn about 
assimilation algorithms while being isolated from the 
additional (extreme) complexity associated with model error and unknown 
observational error characteristics. 
In other words, for the real-world assimilation problem, the model has 
(often substantial) differences from what happens in the real system 
and the observational error distribution may be very complicated and 
is certainly not well known. 
Be careful to keep these issues in mind while exploring 
the capabilities of the ensemble filters with synthetic observations.
</P>
