<p>Hawaii is a prior release of DART. Its source code is available via the
<a href="https://github.com/NCAR/DART/tree/Hawaii">DART repository on Github</a>.
This documentation is preserved merely for reference. See the
<a href="https://dart.ucar.edu/">DART homepage</a> to learn about the latest
release.</p>

<a name="OVERVIEW" id="OVERVIEW"></a>
<h2>Overview of DART</h2>
<p>The Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) is designed to
facilitate the combination of assimilation algorithms, models, and
observation sets to allow increased understanding of all three. The
DART programs have been compiled with the Intel 7.1 Fortran
compiler and run on a linux compute-server. If your system is
different, you will definitely need to read the <a href=
"#customizations">Customizations</a> section.

<p>DART programs can require three different types of input. First,
some of the DART programs, those for creating synthetic
observational datasets, require interactive input from the
keyboard. For simple cases, this interactive input can be made
directly from the keyboard. In more complicated cases, a file
containing the appropriate keyboard input can be created and this
file can be directed to the standard input of the DART program.
Second, many DART programs expect one or more input files in DART
specific formats to be available. For instance, <em class=
"program">perfect_model_obs</em> creates a synthetic observation
set given a particular model and a description of a sequence of
observations requires an input file that describes this observation
sequence. At present, the observation files for DART are
inefficient but human-readable ascii files in a custom format.
Third, many DART modules (including main programs) make use of the
Fortan90 namelist facility to obtain values of certain parameters
at run-time. All programs look for a namelist input file called
<em class="file">input.nml</em> in the directory in which the
program is executed. The <em class="file">input.nml</em> file can
contain a sequence of individual Fortran90 namelists which specify
values of particular parameters for modules that compose the
executable program. Unfortunately, the Fortran90 namelist interface
is poorly defined in the language standard, leaving considerable
leeway to compiler developers in implementing the facility. The
Intel 7.1 compiler has some particularly unpleasant behavior when a
namelist file contains an entry that is NOT defined in the program
reading the namelist. Error behavior is unpredictable, but often
results in read errors for other input files opened by DART
programs. If you encounter run-time read errors, the first course
of action should be to ensure the components of the namelist are
actual components. Changing the names of the namelist components
<strong>will</strong> create unpleasantries. DART provides a
mechanism that automatically generates namelists with the default
values for each program to be run.</p>
<p>DART uses the <a href=
"http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/">netCDF</a>
self-describing data format with a particular metadata convention
to describe output that is used to analyze the results of
assimilation experiments. These files have the extension <em class=
"file">.nc</em> and can be read by a number of standard data
analysis tools. A set of <a href=
"http://www.mathworks.com/">Matlab</a> scripts, designed to produce
graphical diagnostics from DART netCDF output files are available.
DART users have also used <a href=
"http://meteora.ucsd.edu/~pierce/ncview_home_page.html">ncview</a>
to create rudimentary graphical displays of output data fields. The
<a href="http://nco.sourceforge.net">NCO</a> tools, produced by
UCAR's Unidata group, are available to do operations like
concatenating, slicing, and dicing of netCDF files.</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>This document outlines the installation of the DART software and
the system requirements. For convenience, some of the original
colloquium exercises are repeated here, mostly just to check the
installation. A few of the <a href=
"dart_exercise_doc.pdf">exercises from the ASP summer 2003
Colloquium</a> are repeated here, primarily to serve as the
verification of the installation. The entire installation process
is summarized in the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#compilers">Determine which F90 compiler is
available</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#netCDFlib">Determine the location of the <em class=
"code">netCDF</em> library</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#udunits">Determine the location of the <em class=
"code">udunits</em> library</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#download">Download the DART software bundle and untar
it into the expected source tree</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#customizations">Modify certain DART files to reflect
the available F90 compiler and location of the appropriate
libraries</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#building">Build the executables</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We have tried to make the code as portable as possible, but we
do not have access to all compilers on all platforms, so there are
no guarantees. We are interested in your experience building the
system, so please email me (Tim Hoar)
thoar 'at' ucar 'dot' edu (trying to cut down

<h2>Requirements: the <em class="file">netCDF</em> library</h2>
<p>DART uses the <a href=
"http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/">netCDF</a>
self-describing data format for the results of assimilation
experiments. These files have the extension <em class=
"file">.nc</em> and can be read by a number of standard data
analysis tools. In particular, DART also makes use of the F90
interface to the library which is available through the <em class=
"file">netcdf.mod</em> and <em class="file">typesizes.mod</em>
modules. <em class="bold">IMPORTANT</em>: different compilers
create these modules with different "case" filenames, and sometimes
they are not <strong>both</strong> installed into the expected
directory. It is required that both modules be present. The normal
place would be in the <tt>netcdf/include</tt> directory, as opposed
to the <tt>netcdf/lib</tt> directory.</p>
<p>If the netCDF library does not exist on your system, you must
build it (as well as the F90 interface modules). The library and
instructions for building the library or installing from an RPM may
be found at the netCDF home page: <a href=
"http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/</a>
Pay particular attention to the compiler-specific patches that must
be applied for the Intel Fortran Compiler. (Or the PG compiler, for
that matter.)</p>
<p>The location of the netCDF library, <em class=
"file">libnetcdf.a</em>, and the locations of both <em class=
"file">netcdf.mod</em> and <em class="file">typesizes.mod</em> will
be needed by the makefile template, as described in the <a href=
"#compiling">compiling</a> section.</p>
<!--==================================================================-->
<a name="udunits" id="udunits"></a>
<hr>
<h2>Requirements: the <em class="file">udunits</em> library</h2>
<p>Certain components of DART (i.e. the MPI version of the bgrid
model) also use the <strong>very</strong> common <a href=
"http://my.unidata.ucar.edu/content/software/udunits/index.html">udunits</a>
library for manipulating units of physical quantities. If, somehow,
it is not installed on your system, you will need to install it
(instructions are available from <a href=
"http://www.unidata.ucar.edu">Unidata's Downloads</a> page).</p>
<p>The location of the udunits library, <em class=
"file">libudunits.a</em>, will be needed by the makefile template,
as described in the <a href="#compiling">compiling</a> section.
<strong>If you are not using the MPI version of the bgrid model,
you should remove the <em class="file">libudunits.a</em> option
from the makefile template.</strong></p>

<h2>Unpacking the distribution.</h2>
<p>This release of the <a href="https://github.com/NCAR/DART/releases/tag/v4.0.0">
DART source code can be downloaded</a> as a compressed zip or tar.gz file.
When extracted, the source tree will begin with a directory
named <em class="file">DART</em> and will be approximately 30.7 Mb.
Compiling the code in this tree (as is usually the case) will
necessitate much more space.</p>
<pre>
<code>
$ gunzip DART-4.0.0.tar.gz
$ tar -xvf DART-4.0.0.tar
</code>
</pre>

<p>The code tree is very "bushy"; there are many directories of
support routines, etc. but only a few directories involved with the
customization and installation of the DART software. If you can
compile and run ONE of the low-order models, you should be able to
compile and run ANY of the low-order models. For this reason, we
can focus on the Lorenz `63 model. Subsequently, the only
directories with files to be modified to check the installation
are:  <em class="file">DART_hawaii/mkmf</em>,  <em class=
"file">DART_hawaii/models/lorenz_63/work</em>, and  <em class=
"file">DART_hawaii/matlab</em> (but only for analysis).</p>

<h2>Customizing the build scripts -- Overview.</h2>
<p>DART executable programs are constructed using two tools:
<em class="program">make</em> and <em class="program">mkmf</em>.
The <em class="program">make</em> utility is a relatively common
piece of software that requires a user-defined input file that
records dependencies between different source files. <em class=
"program">make</em> then performs a hierarchy of actions when one
or more of the source files is modified. The <em class=
"program">mkmf</em> utility is a custom preprocessor that generates
a <em class="program">make</em> input file (named <em class=
"file">Makefile</em>) and an example namelist <em class=
"file">input.nml.mkmf</em> with the default values. The <em class=
"file">Makefile</em> is designed specifically to work with
object-oriented Fortran90 (and other languages) for systems like
DART.</p>
<p><em class="program">mkmf</em> requires two separate input files.
The first is a `template' file which specifies details of the
commands required for a specific Fortran90 compiler and may also
contain pointers to directories containing pre-compiled utilities
required by the DART system. <strong>This template file will need
to be modified to reflect your system</strong>. The second input
file is a `path_names' file which includes a complete list of the
locations (either relative or absolute) of all Fortran90 source
files that are required to produce a particular DART program. Each
'path_names' file must contain a path for exactly one Fortran90
file containing a main program, but may contain any number of
additional paths pointing to files containing Fortran90 modules. An
<em class="program">mkmf</em> command is executed which uses the
'path_names' file and the mkmf template file to produce a
<em class="file">Makefile</em> which is subsequently used by the
standard <em class="program">make</em> utility.</p>
<p>Shell scripts that execute the mkmf command for all standard
DART executables are provided as part of the standard DART
software. For more information on <em class="program">mkmf</em> see
<a href=
"http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/fms/pubrel/j/atm_dycores/bin/mkmf.html">the
FMS mkmf description</a>.</p>

<p>One of the benefits of using <em class="program">mkmf</em> is that
it also creates an example namelist file for each program. The
example namelist is called <em class=
"file">input.nml.</em><i>filter</i><em class="file">_default</em>,
for example, so as not to clash with any exising <em class=
"file">input.nml</em> that may exist in that directory.</p>
<a name="template" id="template"></a>
<h3 class="indent1">Building and Customizing the 'mkmf.template'
file</h3>
<p>A series of templates for different compilers/architectures
exists in the <em class="file">DART_hawaii/mkmf/</em> directory and
have names with extensions that identify either the compiler, the
architecture, or both. This is how you inform the build process of
the specifics of your system. Our intent is that you copy one that
is similar to your system into <em class="file">mkmf.template</em>
and customize it. For the discussion that follows, knowledge of the
contents of one of these templates (i.e. <em class=
"file">mkmf.template.pgf90.ghotiol</em>) is needed: (note that only
the first few uncommented lines are shown here)</p>
<pre>
<code>
FC = pgf90
LD = pgf90
CPPFLAGS =
LIST = -Mlist
NETCDF = /contrib/netcdf-3.5.1-cc-c++-pgif90.5.2-4
FFLAGS = -O0 -Ktrap=fp -pc 64 -I$(NETCDF)/include
LIBS = -L$(NETCDF)/lib -lnetcdf
LDFLAGS = $(LIBS)

# you should never need to change any lines below.
...
</code>
</pre>
<p>Essentially, each of the lines defines some part of the
resulting <em class="file">Makefile</em>. Since <em class=
"program">make</em> is particularly good at sorting out
dependencies, the order of these lines really doesn't make any
difference. The <em class="code">FC = pgf90</em> line ultimately
defines the Fortran90 compiler to use, etc.</p>
<a name="fflags" id="fflags"></a>
<h4 class="indent2">FFLAGS</h4>
<p class="indent1">Each compiler has different compile flags, so
there is really no way to exhaustively cover this other than to say
the templates as we supply them should work -- we usually turn the
optimization off and try to use 64 bit arithmetic instead of 80 so
we can more reasonably compare the results across
architectures.</p>
<a name="netcdf" id="netcdf"></a>
<h4 class="indent2">NETCDF</h4>
<p class="indent1">The variable which most likely needs a
site-specific change is <em class="code">NETCDF</em>. Configure
your <em class="code">NETCDF</em> variable such that you have a<br>
<em class="code">$(NETCDF)/include/typesizes.mod</em><br>
<em class="code">$(NETCDF)/include/netcdf.mod</em><br>
<em class="code">$(NETCDF)/lib/libnetcdf.a</em><br>
Depending on the compiler, the case of the modules might be
different, i.e., your system might have a <em class=
"code">TYPESIZES.mod</em>, or <em class="code">Typesizes.mod</em>
... anything goes.</p>
<a name="path_names" id="path_names"></a>
<h3 class="indent1">Customizing the 'path_names_*' file</h3>
<p>Several <em class="file">path_names_*</em> files are provided in
the <em class="file">work</em> directory for each specific model,
in this case: <em class=
"file">DART_hawaii/models/lorenz_63/work</em>.</p>
<ol>
<li><em class="file">path_names_create_obs_sequence</em></li>
<li><em class="file">path_names_create_fixed_network_seq</em></li>
<li><em class="file">path_names_perfect_model_obs</em></li>
<li><em class="file">path_names_filter</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Since each model comes with its own set of files, no further
customization is needed.</p>

<h2>Building the Lorenz_63 DART project.</h2>
<p>Currently, DART executables are constructed in a <em class=
"file">work</em> subdirectory under the directory containing code
for the given model. In the top-level DART directory, change to the
L63 work directory and list the contents:</p>
<pre>
<code>
$ cd DART_hawaii/models/lorenz_63/work
$ ls -1
</code>
</pre>

<p>With the result:</p>
<pre>
<code>
filter_ics 
mkmf_create_fixed_network_seq 
mkmf_create_obs_sequence 
mkmf_filter 
mkmf_perfect_model_obs 
path_names_create_fixed_network_seq 
path_names_create_obs_sequence 
path_names_filter 
path_names_perfect_model_obs 
perfect_ics
</code>
</pre>
<p>There are four <em class="file">mkmf_</em><em class=
"italic">xxxxxx</em> files for the programs <em class=
"program">create_obs_sequence</em>, <em class=
"program">create_fixed_network_seq</em>, <em class=
"program">perfect_model_obs</em>, and <em class=
"program">filter</em> along with the corresponding <em class=
"file">path_names_</em><em class="italic">xxxxxx</em> files. You
can examine the contents of one of the <em class=
"file">path_names_</em><em class="italic">xxxxxx</em> files, for
instance <em class="file">path_names_filter</em>, to see a list of
the relative paths of all files that contain Fortran90 modules
required for the program <em class="program">filter</em> for the
L63 model. All of these paths are relative to your <em class=
"file">DART_hawaii</em> directory. The first path is the main
program (<em class="file">filter.f90</em>) and is followed by all
the Fortran90 modules used by this program.</p>
<p>The <em class="program">mkmf_</em><em class="italic">xxxxxx</em>
scripts are cryptic but should not need to be modified -- as long
as you do not restructure the code tree (by moving directories, for
example). The only function of the <em class=
"program">mkmf_</em><em class="italic">xxxxxx</em> script is to
generate a <em class="file">Makefile</em> and an instance of the
default namelist file: <em class="file">input.nml.</em><em class=
"italic">xxxxxx</em><em class="file">_default</em>. It is not
supposed to compile anything.</p>
<pre>
<code>
$ csh mkmf_create_obs_sequence
$ make
</code>
</pre>

<p>The first command generates an appropriate <em class=
"file">Makefile</em> and the <em class=
"file">input.nml.create_obs_sequence_default</em> file. The
<em class="program">make</em> command results in the compilation of
a series of Fortran90 modules which ultimately produces an
executable file: <em class="program">create_obs_sequence</em>.
Should you need to make any changes to the <em class=
"file">DART_hawaii/mkmf/mkmf.template</em>, (<i>i.e.</i> change
compile options) you will need to regenerate the <em class=
"file">Makefile</em>. A series of object files for each module
compiled will also be left in the work directory, as some of these
are undoubtedly needed by the build of the other DART components.
You can proceed to create the other three programs needed to work
with L63 in DART as follows:</p>

<pre>
<code>
$ csh mkmf_create_fixed_network_seq
$ make
$ csh mkmf_perfect_model_obs
$ make
$ csh mkmf_filter
$ make
</code>
</pre>

<p>
The result (hopefully) is that four executables now reside in your
work directory. The most common problem is that the netCDF
libraries and include files (particularly <em class=
"file">typesizes.mod</em>) are not found. If this is the case; edit
the <em class="file">DART_hawaii/mkmf/mkmf.template</em>, recreate
the <em class="file">Makefile</em>, and try again.</p>

<h2>Running Lorenz_63.</h2>
<p>This initial sequence of exercises includes detailed
instructions on how to work with the DART code and allows
investigation of the basic features of one of the most famous
dynamical systems, the 3-variable Lorenz-63 model. The remarkable
complexity of this simple model will also be used as a case study
to introduce a number of features of a simple ensemble filter data
assimilation system. To perform a synthetic observation
assimilation experiment for the L63 model, the following steps must
be performed (an overview of the process is given first, followed
by detailed procedures for each step):</p>
<h2 class="indent1">Experiment Overview</h2>
<ol>
<li><a href="#integrate">Integrate the L63 model for a long
time</a><br>
starting from arbitrary initial conditions to generate a model
state that lies on the attractor. The ergodic nature of the L63
system means a 'lengthy' integration always converges to some point
on the computer's finite precision representation of the model's
attractor.<br>
<br></li>
<li><a href="#ensemblate">Generate a set of ensemble initial
conditions</a><br>
from which to start an assimilation. Since L63 is ergodic, the
ensemble members can be designed to look like random samples from
the model's 'climatological distribution'. To generate an ensemble
member, very small perturbations can be introduced to the state on
the attractor generated by step 1. This perturbed state can then be
integrated for a very long time until all memory of its initial
condition can be viewed as forgotten. Any number of ensemble
initial conditions can be generated by repeating this
procedure.<br>
<br></li>
<li><a href="#simulate">Simulate a particular observing
system</a><br>
by first creating an 'observation set definition' and then creating
an 'observation sequence'. The 'observation set definition'
describes the instrumental characteristics of the observations and
the 'observation sequence' defines the temporal sequence of the
observations.<br>
<br></li>
<li><a href="#generate">Populate the 'observation sequence' with
'perfect' observations</a><br>
by integrating the model and using the information in the
'observation sequence' file to create simulated observations. This
entails operating on the model state at the time of the observation
with an appropriate forward operator (a function that operates on
the model state vector to produce the expected value of the
particular observation) and then adding a random sample from the
observation error distribution specified in the observation set
definition. At the same time, diagnostic output about the 'true'
state trajectory can be created.<br>
<br></li>
<li><a href="#assimilate">Assimilate the synthetic
observations</a><br>
by running the filter; diagnostic output is generated.</li>
</ol>
<a name="integrate" id="integrate"></a>
<h3 class="indent1">1. Integrate the L63 model for a 'long'
time.</h3>
<em class="program">perfect_model_obs</em> integrates the model for
all the times specified in the 'observation sequence definition'
file. To this end, begin by creating an 'observation sequence
definition' file that spans a long time. Creating an 'observation
sequence definition' file is a two-step procedure involving
<em class="program">create_obs_sequence</em> followed by <em class=
"program">create_fixed_network_seq</em>. After they are both run,
it is necessary to integrate the model with <em class=
"program">perfect_model_obs</em>.
<h4 class="indent1">1.1 Create an observation set definition.</h4>
<p><em class="program">create_obs_sequence</em> creates an
observation set definition, the time-independent part of an
observation sequence. An observation set definition file only
contains the <em class="code">location, type,</em> and <em class=
"code">observational error characteristics</em> (normally just the
diagonal observational error variance) for a related set of
observations. There are no actual observations. For spin-up, we are
only interested in integrating the L63 model, not in generating any
particular synthetic observations. Begin by creating a minimal
observation set definition.<br>

<br>
In general, for the low-order models, only a single observation set
need be defined. Next, the number of individual scalar observations
(like a single surface pressure observation) in the set is needed.
To spin-up an initial condition for the L63 model, only a single
observation is needed. Next, the error variance for this
observation must be entered. Since we do not need (nor want) this
observation to have any impact on an assimilation (it will only be
used for spinning up the model and the ensemble), enter a very
large value for the error variance. An observation with a very
large error variance has essentially no impact on deterministic
filter assimilations like the default variety implemented in DART.
Finally, the location and type of the observation need to be
defined. For all types of models, the most elementary form of
synthetic observations are called 'identity' observations. These
observations are generated simply by adding a random sample from a
specified observational error distribution directly to the value of
one of the state variables. This defines the observation as being

<p><em class="program">create_fixed_network_seq</em> creates an

<br>
The first input is the name of the file created in the previous
step, <i>i.e.</i> the name of the observation set definition that
you've just created. It is possible to create sequences in which
the observation sets are observed at regular intervals or
irregularly in time. Here, all we need is a sequence that takes
observations over a long period of time - indicated by entering a
1. Although the L63 system normally is defined as having a
non-dimensional time step, the DART system arbitrarily defines the
model timestep as being 3600 seconds. By declaring we have 1000
observations taken once per day, we create an observation sequence
definition spanning 24000 'model' timesteps; sufficient to spin-up
the model onto the attractor. Finally, enter a name for the
'observation sequence definition' file. Note again: there are no
observation values present in this file. Just an observation type,
location, time and the error characteristics. We are going to
populate the observation sequence with the <em class=

<h3 class="indent1">2. Generate a set of ensemble initial
conditions.</h3>
<p class="indent1">The set of initial conditions for a 'perfect
model' experiment is created by taking the spun-up state of the
model (available in <em class="file">perfect_restart</em>), running
<em class="program">perfect_model_obs</em> to generate the 'true
state' of the experiment and a corresponding set of observations,
and then feeding the same initial spun-up state and resulting
observations into <em class="program">filter</em>.<br>
<br>
Generating ensemble initial conditions is achieved by changing a
perfect_model_obs namelist parameter, copying <em class=
"file">perfect_restart</em> to <em class="file">perfect_ics</em>,
and rerunning <em class="program">perfect_model_obs</em>. This
execution of <em class="program">perfect_model_obs</em> will
advance the model state from the end of the first 24,000 steps
(i.e. the spun-up state) to the end of an additional 24,000 steps

also uses the Fortran90 namelist mechanism for input. It is now

  DART : Plots summary plots of the ensemble error and ensemble spread.

  Ultimately, plot_ens_err_spread will be replaced by a GUI.
  All the heavy lifting is done by PlotEnsErrSpread.
 
  Example 1 (for low-order models)

<p>And the matlab graphics window will display the spread of the
ensemble error for each state variable. The scripts are designed to
do the "obvious" thing for the low-order models and will prompt for
additional information if needed. The philosophy of these is that
anything that starts with a lower-case <em class=

intended to be user-callable and should handle any of the models.

<h2>Bias, filter divergence and covariance inflation (with the L63
model)</h2>
One of the common problems with ensemble filters is filter
divergence, which can also be an issue with a variety of other
flavors of filters including the classical Kalman filter. In filter
divergence, the prior estimate of the model state becomes too
confident, either by chance or because of errors in the forecast
model, the observational error characteristics, or approximations
in the filter itself. If the filter is inappropriately confident
that its prior estimate is correct, it will then tend to give less
weight to observations than they should be given. The result can be
enhanced overconfidence in the model's state estimate. In severe
cases, this can spiral out of control and the ensemble can wander
entirely away from the truth, confident that it is correct in its
estimate. In less severe cases, the ensemble estimates may not
diverge entirely from the truth but may still be too confident in
their estimate. The result is that the truth ends up being farther
away from the filter estimates than the spread of the filter
ensemble would estimate. This type of behavior is commonly detected
using rank histograms (also known as Talagrand diagrams). You can
see the rank histograms for the L63 initial assimilation by using
the matlab script <em class="program">plot_bins</em>.
<p>A simple, but surprisingly effective way of dealing with filter
divergence is known as covariance inflation. In this method, the
prior ensemble estimate of the state is expanded around its mean by
a constant factor, effectively increasing the prior estimate of
uncertainty while leaving the prior mean estimate unchanged. The
program <em class="program">filter</em> has a namelist parameter
that controls the application of covariance inflation, <em class=
"code">cov_inflate</em>. Up to this point, <em class=
"code">cov_inflate</em> has been set to 1.0 indicating that the
prior ensemble is left unchanged. Increasing <em class=
"code">cov_inflate</em> to values greater than 1.0 inflates the
ensemble before assimilating observations at each time they are
available. Values smaller than 1.0 contract (reduce the spread) of
prior ensembles before assimilating.</p>
<p>You can do this by modifying the value of <em class=
"code">cov_inflate</em> in the namelist, (try 1.05 and 1.10 and
other values at your discretion) and run the filter as above. In
each case, use the diagnostic matlab tools to examine the resulting
changes to the error, the ensemble spread (via rank histogram bins,
too), etc. What kind of relation between spread and error is seen
in this model?</p>

<h2>Synthetic Observations</h2>
<p>Synthetic observations are generated from a `perfect' model
integration, which is often referred to as the `truth' or a `nature
run'. A model is integrated forward from some set of initial
conditions and observations are generated as <em class="equation">y
= H(x) + e</em> where <em class="equation">H</em> is an operator on
the model state vector, <em class="equation">x</em>, that gives the
expected value of a set of observations, <em class=
"equation">y</em>, and <em class="equation">e</em> is a random
variable with a distribution describing the error characteristics
of the observing instrument(s) being simulated. Using synthetic
observations in this way allows students to learn about
assimilation algorithms while being isolated from the additional
(extreme) complexity associated with model error and unknown
observational error characteristics. In other words, for the
real-world assimilation problem, the model has (often substantial)
differences from what happens in the real system and the
observational error distribution may be very complicated and is
certainly not well known. Be careful to keep these issues in mind
while exploring the capabilities of the ensemble filters with
synthetic observations.</p>
