<H1>DART "POST Iceland release" summary of changes.</H1>
<!-- version tag follows, do not edit --><P>$Id$</P>

<P>
The DART POST Iceland release (16 June 2006) is an intermediate
release designed to provide error fixes required for a number
of users and to provide enhanced support for the CAM, WRF, and
PBL_1D models.  It also provides several
new assimilation algorithm options that are already widely
used by CAM implementations. The most important are 
additional methods for doing adaptive inflation. The previously
existing observation space inflation is retained and two
new options for adaptive state space inflation are introduced.
One option has a value of inflation that is constant across 
all state variables but varies in time. The second has an
inflation factor for EACH state variable and these can each
vary in time. An initial version of an algorithm to do 
adaptive localization is also introduced. The local density
of observations is measured by computing the number of 
observations from a set at a given time that is close to the
observation being assimilated. If the density is such that
more than a given threshold number of observations is close
to the current observation, the localization radius is adjusted
so that the expected number of observations in the adjusted
radius is equal to the threshold value. This will decrease
the localization radius in areas with dense observations.
<BR>
<BR>
Another important new capability is provided by a 
<em class=program>merge_obs_sequence</em> program that can 
combine most existing observation sequences into a single sequence.
<BR>
<BR>
The <em>shell scripts</em> used to coordinate the execution of the model
advances or regional assimilation have been modified to be more
robust and easier to read. Furthermore, each script has been
standardized to be much more machine/queueing system independent.
Each script should now be able to be used interactively (in a debug scenario),
with the LSF queueing system (as a batch job), or with the PBS queueing system. 
The scripts have a block of logic that converts the system-specific variables
to ones commonly used throughout the DART documentation. This has now
made it possible to prepare a script that will conditionally execute
a series of batch jobs wherein each batch job will process exactly one
observation sequence file. Only upon successful completion of the 
previous batch job with the subsequent batch job be started. Look for
information on <em class=file>Qfiller.csh</em> on the DART www page.
<BR>
<BR>
<em class=program>merge_obs_sequence</em> program that can 
combine most existing observation sequences into a single sequence.
<BR>
<BR>
An initial version of an ensemble smoother was added to DART
and implemented with the low-order models and the bgrid model.
The smoother continues to use the OLD inflation options and an
old version of the <em class=program>assim_tools_mod</em> module.

<h2>Changes</h2>
A summary list of changes occurring in each DART directory/file follows:

<TABLE width=95%>

<TR><TD valign=top><em class=file>test_dart.csh</em></TD>
<TD> This testing script in the main DART directory has been updated
to test the new inflation options with the new scripts. An attempt has been
made to preserve the input environment such that if you wanted to run it
twice in a row, you could. It now stores all the run-time output of the lorenz_96
tests in the <em class=file>lorenz_96/work/xxxx</em> directory, where xxx is
now an argument to <em class=file>test_dart.csh</em>. Simply typing the file name
will now echo usage notes.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top><em class=file>adaptive_inflate.f90</em></TD>
<TD> This new module now handles all the computations for the 
adaptive inflation computations. It has the code that was previously
in <em class=program>assim_tools</em> to do the Bayesian update of 
observation space inflation. It also provides the additional 
algorithms required to do state space inflation. 
Documentation is provided in the module and in several 
papers on the DART home page.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top><em class=file>assim_tools_mod.f90</em></TD>
<TD>
Uses <em class=program>adaptive_inflation</em> module. 
Namelist modified (see below). Storage
for observation space inflation for regions no longer needed. No longer an
<em class=file>assim_restart</em> file; all restart info is now stored in 
<em class=program>adaptive_inflate</em>.
Routine <em class=code>update_inflation</em> replaces 
<em class=code>bayes_cov_inflate</em> which has been moved
to <em class=code>adaptive_inflate_mod</em>. 
Correlation is now passed out of <em class=code>update_from_obs_inc</em>
for use with adaptive inflation updates. Ability to do
sampling_error_correction from a file using <em class=file>correl_error.f90</em> 
in <em class=code>system_simulation</em>.
This is turned on by namelist parameter <em
class=code>sampling_error_correction</em> and requires
appropriate error correction files for a given ensemble size (this is still
in preliminary testing phase). The inflation values are now passed into
<em class=code>filter_assim_region</em>. The mean and variance of the observation space priors
are computed up front in <em class=code>filter_assim_region</em> for use with adaptive inflation
algorithm. Observational density thinning controlled by namelist parameter
<em class=code>num_close_threshold</em> implemented. If number of observations close to a given
observation is larger than the cutoff, the localization cutoff is adjusted
to try to make the number close the same as the cutoff. This is a fundamentally
two-d algorithm in this naive implementation. Update computations for
spatial inflation are included in <em class=code>filter_assim_region</em>. 
Routine <em class=code>filter_assim</em>
also gets the inflation values as arguments. Copying of these inflation
values for the shell driven files is added. 
Previously commented <em class=code>print_regional_results</em> is deleted 
(produced errors with absoft compilers).
Routine <em class=code>comp_correl</em> added to compute correlations. 
Routine <em class=code>get_correction_from_file</em> added to support 
<em class=code>sampling_error_correction</em>. 
No longer need routine <em class=code>assim_tools_end</em> since there is no 
longer a restart requirement.
An error in the correlation computation for assimilation was removed. If
all prior values of an observation were identical, a <em class=code>NaN</em> 
could result from the old correlation computation.
The <em class=code>assim_tools_nml</em> was modified as follows: 
Removed <em class=code>cov_inflate, cov_inflate_sd, sd_lower_bound, 
deterministic_cov_inflate, start_from_assim_restart, assim_restart_in_file_name, 
assim_restart_out_file_name, cov_inflate_upper_bound</em>.
Added <em class=code>sampling_error_correction</em> and
<em class=code>num_close_threshold</em>.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top><em class=file>assim_tools_smoother.f90</em></TD>
<TD> The smoother is still using the previous version of inflation and the
corresponding <em class=code>assim_tools module</em> which has been renamed 
as <em class=code>assim_tools_smoother</em>.
Additional routines have been added to support the updates required to do 
smoothing (see documentation in smoother directory).
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>diagnostics</TD>
<TD> Observation space diagnostics <em class=program>obs_diag</em> were modified 
to support observations on model
levels. This is particularly useful for "perfect model" experiments. Direct
observations of model variables (identity observations) are <em>not</em>
supported, as this is an exploration of state-space, not observation-space.
However, since the advent of <em class=program>merge_obs_sequence</em> (see below)
an observation sequence file <em>may</em> contain synthetic and real observations.
Any identity observations are skipped. All other observations may be considered.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top><em class=file>ensemble_manager_mod.f90</em></TD>
<TD> Modified to be able to handle multiple ensembles at one time to support
the smoother which has an ensemble for each lag-time in the smoothing.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top><em class=file>filter.f90</em></TD>
<TD>
The <em class=code>adaptive_inflate</em> module is now used and the namelist entry
<em class=code>cov_inflate</em> has been removed from <em class=code>filter_nml</em>. 
Inflation is now done with <em class=code>filter_ensemble_inflate</em> only if 
constant or varying spatial inflation is selected in the 
<em class=code>adaptive_inflate </em>namelist. 
Information about state space inflation is passed
to <em class=code>filter_assim</em> as arguments. 
The call to <em class=code>assim_tools_end</em> has
been replace by <em class=code>adaptive_inflate_end</em> which creates restarts for
adaptive inflation. For spatially varying state inflation, two
extra fields are tacked onto the state space diagnostic netcdf
files to record the inflation mean and standard deviation. At
present, inflation is done for the whole state at once; this may
be very inefficient and should be examined.
The entry <em class=code>cov_inflate</em> was removed from the namelist.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top><em class=file>merge_obs_seq.f90</em></TD>
<TD>This is a fundamentally new program to DART. This routine can combine any two
observation sequence files that are compatible. The files are deemed compatible if
the 'copies' of the observations and the QC fields are <em>identical</em> between
the two sequences. If one observation sequence file has only an ensemble mean and
spread, the other observation sequence file can have <em>only</em> an ensemble
mean and spread -- it cannot additionally have the N ensemble member estimates of the
observation. Most of the time, this routine is envisioned to be used to combine
<em class=file>obs_seq.out</em> files (as opposed to 
<em class=file>obs_seq.final</em> files). If the two sequences temporally overlap,
it is faster to put the shorter sequence as <em class=code>filenam_seq2</em>, the
insertion sort can get tedious. 
A new namelist <em class=code>merge_obs_seq_nml</em> has been added. 
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>mkmf</TD>
<TD>New templates provided to support corral and lightning at NCAR.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>models</TD>
<TD> All models work with <em class=program>merge_obs_seq</em> and adaptive 
inflation options.</TD></TR>
 
<TR><TD valign=top>PBL_1d</TD>
<TD>The PBL_1d model has undergone extensive revisions as per the author's
instructions. The DART portion of the code (i.e. those modules not directly
imported from WRF) now compile cleanly with a variety of compilers. Note that 
because of the WRF convention of naming modules with a <em class=file>.F</em>
extension (instead of <em class=file>.F90</em> or <em class=file>.f90</em>)
several compilers try to interpret this code as fixed-format code when it is,
in fact, free-format. This necessitates setting the compiler flags to
<em>force</em> the free-format interpretation. See your compiler for details.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>models/cam-fv</TD>
<TD>is a new model ... the finite-volume core version of CAM.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>models/cam</TD>
<TD>Now able to handle observations with height as a vertical coordinate. 
Can return interpolated values of pressure for use with GPS observation
forward operators.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>cam/shell_scripts/<em class=file>job.simple.csh</em></TD>
    <TD>is a new script that demonstrates the simplest possible (I think)
        way to assimilate ONE observation sequence file with CAM. It requires
        CAM restart files and the like, so it WILL need to be modified to
        work for you. Hopefully, you can just change a couple of the directories
        referenced in the script and be off ...
        This is likely to be the underpinnings of the next generation
        script that will flood the queue with conditionally executed batch jobs.
        If the observation sequence file for 06Z completes normally, the batch job
        for 12Z will start ... that sort of thing. 
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>doc/html/cgd_cam.shtml</TD>
<TD>New, more general information about using CAM and DART is 
available in <a href="http://www.image.ucar.edu/DAReS/DART/cgd_cam.shtml">
cgd_cam.shtml</A>.</TD></TR>


<TR><TD valign=top>models/wrf</TD>
<TD>A new namelist variable, <em class=code>assimilation_period_seconds</em>, 
    allows the specification of the desired assimilation period, which was 
    previously hardwired in the code. 
    The <em class=code>assimilation_period_seconds</em> is guaranteed to be 
    an integer multiple of the underlying wrf model timestep.
    Added support for gps observations and observations of vortex position.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>ncep_obs</TD>
<TD> Made changes to improve translation from <em class=program>prep_bufr</em>. 
Data from up to 3:00 UTC of the next day is included in the file with the 
current days' date. 
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top><em class=file>obs_def_gps_mod.f90</em></TD>
    <TD>Modified to allow merging of two gps observation sequences.
    </TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top><em class=file>obs_def_radar_mod.f90</em></TD>
    <TD>Added ability to merge multiple observation sequences.
    </TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top><em class=file>obs_def_vortex_mod.f90</em></TD>
    <TD>Provides observation types for position of vortex center.
    </TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top><em class=file>obs_model_mod.f90</em></TD>
    <TD>Modified to be compatible with smoother use of multiple ensemble handles.
    </TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top><em class=file>obs_sequence_mod.f90</em></TD>
    <TD>Added initialization for observation sequence in
        <em class=code>init_obs_sequence</em>; 
        prevents possible access to uninitialized pointer.
    </TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top><em class=file>preprocess.f90</em></TD>
    <TD>Changed defaults for input and output files to standard values rather 
        than null.
    </TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>DART/shell_scripts (the machine-specific ones)</TD>
    <TD><em class=file>filter_server.csh, assim_filter.csh</em>, and
        <em class=file>advance_ens.csh</em> have been modified to use
        'standard' language and can be used with multiple queuing systems
        as well as interactively. Extensive commenting has been added to 
        help explain the semaphore files. All the other scripts in this 
        directory should be considered 'deprecated'. 
    </TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>model/xxx/shell_scripts (the model-specific ones)</TD>
    <TD><em class=file>advance_model.csh</em>, and
        <em class=file>assim_region.csh</em> have been modified to use
        'standard' language and can be used with multiple queuing systems
        as well as interactively. Extensive commenting has been added to 
        help explain the semaphore files. All the other scripts in this 
        directory should be considered 'deprecated'.

<TR><TD valign=top>smoother</TD>
    <TD>A main program (<em class=file>smoother.f90</em>) to do 
        fixed-lag ensemble smoothing has been added and is documented 
        in the smoother directory. This program still uses the 
        previous version of the inflation and <em class=code>assim_tools</em>,
        which are available as 
        <em class=file>assim_tools/assim_tools_smoother_mod.f90</em>.
    </TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top><em class=file>time_manager_mod.f90</em></TD>
    <TD>Corrected problems with module initialization and modified print format
        to strictly comply such that it now compiles with gfortran.
    </TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>tutorial</TD>
    <TD>Modified section 12 to give accurate discussion of new implementation
    of observation space inflation and a brief overview of the state space inflation
    options.
