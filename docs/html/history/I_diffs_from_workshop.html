<P>
The DART Iceland release (23 Nov 2005) is expected to be the last update that 
makes major modifications to the user interfaces to DART and the
DART interfaces to models or observations. The primary purpose of
this release is to improve the way that DART handles observation
sequences. The goal is to provide a more modular fashion for adding
new types of observations with potentially complex forward 
operators and arbitrary amounts and types of metadata that are
needed to define a particular observation. Limited backward
compatibility has been implemented for existing observation sequence
files, however, it is strongly recommended that users switch 
to the new format as quickly as possible.
</P>

<h2>Improvements</h2>
<P>
The changes to the observation sequences impact large portions of
the DART code. In addition, Iceland also implements a number of
other improvements and additions to DART and fixes several known
bugs from earlier releases. Highlights of the changes from the 
workshop and Hawaii releases are:
</P>

<OL>
<li>Namelist error detection.<br> Enhanced error checking capabilities
for DART namelist reads are included. The input.nml must now
contain an entry for each namelist that is read by a program,
even if none of the values in that namelist entry are set. For
instance, if a program that uses the assim_tools_mod is run,
input.nml MUST contain an entry &amp;assim_tools_nml. Any namelist
values to be set must follow this and the list is terminated
by a /. If no entries are to be set in a given namelist, it must
still be terminated by a line that contains only a slash (/).
If a variable that is NOT in a given namelist is found in input.nml,
a fatal error occurs. Failing to terminate a namelist with 
slash is also fatal. Tools to support this improved namelist
error detection are implemented in utilities_mod and can be used
to check for errors in other applications.</li>

<li>Automatic detection of input file format.<br> Restart and observation
sequence files can be written in binary or ascii as in previous 
releases. However, file formats for reads are now detected 
automatically. The namelist entries 'read_binary_restart_files' in
assim_model_nml and 'read_binary_obs_sequence' in obs_sequence_nml
have been removed.</li>

<li>Error corrected in threed_sphere/location_mod.<br> An error in the
Hawaii and Workshop releases led to the possibility of erroneous
computations of distance in the threed_sphere/location_mod. The
error only occurred if the namelist entry 'approximate_distance'
was set to .true. (the default was .false.) and errors were
generally small and confined to observations located in polar 
regions. The result could be that localization was not applied 
properly to polar observations.</li>

<li>Support for reduced precision real computation.<br> For some large
model applications, using reduced precision reals can enhance
performance. The definition of 'real(r8)' in types_mod can now
be modified to support different real precision. Some computations
in the time_manager can fail with reduced precision, so all time
computations now use an independent fixed precision.</li>

<li>Quality control definition change.<br> values written to quality
control (qc) fields by perfect_model_obs and filter have been
modified. If a prior (posterior) forward operator computation fails, 
qc for that observation is incremented by 1000 (1000000). If
the prior (posterior) observation lies outside the outlier_threshold,
the qc for that observation is incremented by 100 (400). </li>

<li>Added obs_sequence file header.<br> Observation sequence files 
(obs_sequence files) now include a metadata header that includes
a list of the names of each observation type that might be used
in the file along with a mapping to an integer for each name in
the file. Old format files without a header are automatically
detected and a default mapping of integer indices for observation
types to observation type names is used. This default mapping works
for most low-order model, bgrid and CAM obs_sequence files. It is
strongly recommended that legacy obs_sequence files be converted
to the new format by inserting a header block with the appropriate
names and integer mappings.</li>

<li>Interactive creation input for obs_sequence files.<br> A standard
method for creating obs_sequence files is to redirect a text file
to standard input and use the interactive creation facility in
create_obs_sequence. Old input files for this procedure may no
longer work correctly and may need to be updated. The new interactive
creation interface allows the name of observations to be used, or
an integer index. However, the integer index is now defined by a 
table in the obs_kind_mod and may change dynamically. Users should
understand this procedure.</li>

<li>obs_def_nml moved to obs_kind_nml.<br> The obs_def_nml in previous 
releases had entries to choose what observation types to assimilate
or evaluate. These entries have been moved to obs_kind_nml and 
obs_def_nml no longer exists.</li>

<li>Preprocessor functionality has changed.<br> While the preprocess program
still needs to be run when setting up DART experiments, it now works
differently. Previously, the preprocessor read obs_def_mod.F90 and 
created obs_def_mod.f90 in a fashion very similar to the standard
CPP preprocessor. The new preprocessor does not look like CPP. It reads
input from DEFAULT_obs_kind_mod.F90, DEFAULT_obs_def_mod.F90, and from
any requested special obs_def modules and creates an obs_kind_mod.f90
and an obs_def_mod.f90. Documentation of this new functionality is 
available in tutorial section 21 and in the html files for preprocess,
obs_kind_mod, and obs_def_mod.</li>

<li>Improved observation space diagnostics interfaces.<br> The observation
space diagnostics program and associated diagnostic tools are now all 
located in the diagnostics directory. The interfaces and controls have
been modified and are described in html documentation and in the 
tutorial section 18. Consistent interfaces for low-order models and 
large three-dimensional atmospheric models have been provided.</li>

</OL>

phase for BUFR file translation. Program create_real_obs has been generalized
to read in portions of days if required and to use the new obs_kind and
obs_def modules and the obs_def_reanalysis_bufr_mod.f90 to include
much more detailed descriptions of the types of observations. The obs_diag

string for an observation kind given the integer kind index. Routine
set_obs_def_key added to set the value of the integer key associated with
an obs_def_type. Provides default mapping for obs_sequence files in the
old format that do not have a header table mapping indices to obs_kind
strings.</TD></TR>

<TD>Replaces obs_kind_mod.f90, preprocessed to create
obs_kind_mod.f90. Includes new 'generic' kind definitions list with 
associated integers. Each observation kind must be associated with one of
these generic kinds. Now has namelist to define what observation kinds are
being assimilated or evaluated plus new namelist error checking. Provides
new interfaces to get information about obs_kind: get_obs_kind_name
returns the observation name string given a kind index; get_obs_kind_index
does the inverse, assimilate_this_obs_kind and evaluate_this_obs_kind
return true if this observation index is one that is to be used in this
way; get_obs_kind_var_type returns the generic kind associated with an
observation type, get_kind_from_menu offers interactive creation capability.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>obs_sequence_mod.f90</TD>
<TD> obs_sequence files now have a header that maps from obs_kind
indices to a string that uniquely identifies the observation kind. Automatic

and inputs information from obs_def_???_mod.f90 files such as obs_def_reanalysis_bufr_mod.
Looks for fixed format text strings in the input files to determine what sections of
code to extract and where to insert them in the DEFAULT files. Namelist includes
the names of the two input DEFAULT files, the names of the output preprocessed files
(normally obs_def_mod.f90 and obs_kind_mod.f90 in the appropriate directories)
and a list of all the obs_def_???_mod.f90 files that are to be incorporated.</TD></TR>
