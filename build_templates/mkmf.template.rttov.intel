#
# FFLAGS   useful for DEBUGGING. NOTE: The intel compiler can provide a lot more
#          information if you LEAVE the object and module files intact.
#          Do not remove the *.o and *.mod files when debugging code.
#
#     -g       include debugging information.  these are all synonyms.
#     -debug full
#     -debug all
#     -O0      setting -g will make this the default (no optimization).
#              it is possible to set -g and then explicitly set -O2 if
#              the behavior being debugged depends on optimization changes.
#     -ftrapuv   traps if a local variable is used before being set
#     -C       enables all runtime checks.  -C and -check all are synonyms.
#     -check all
#     -check <keywords>    enables/disables more specific runtime checks.
#           keywords:  [arg_temp_created,bounds,overflow,format,pointers,uninit]
#     -warn <keywords>  the level of warning messages issued.
#           keywords:  [alignments, argument_checking, declarations,
#                      errors, fileopt, general, ignore_loc,
#                      stderrors, truncated_source, uncalled,
#                      uninitialized, unused, usage, all]
#     -fp-stack-check  catches conditions where the FP stack is not correct.
#           Typically this is when a real function is called as if it were a
#           subroutine, OR a subroutine is called as if it were a function (return
#           values left of FP stack OR too much data is taken off the FP stack)
#     -vec-reportN  controls how much diagnostic output is printed about
#                   loops vectorized by the compiler. N = 0 is silent,
#                   N can have values up to 5.
#     -traceback    tells the compiler to generate extra information in the
#                   object file to provide source file traceback information
#                   when a severe error occurs at run time
#
# FFLAGS   useful for bitwise reproducibility and accuracy control
#          (these will slow down performance to various degrees)
#     -fp-model precise    control how floating point roundoff is done so it is
#                          reproducible from run to run.  in simple tests this
#                          flag alone was enough to create bitwise reproducible
#                          code but slowed execution significantly.
#     -ftz        'flush to zero' underflows result in zero.  set by default if
#                 any -O other than -O0 set, or if -fpe0 or -fpe1 set.
#     -fpeN       controls floating point exception handling.  -fpe0 rounds underflow
#                 to zero and traps on any other exception type.
#     -pc80       set internal FPU precision to 64 bit significand
#                 (default is -pc64 with 53 internal bits)
#
# FFLAGS   useful for production
#     -O2        default.  optimize without too much unrepeatable numerical games
#     -O3        more aggressive optimizations.  check numerical differences
#                before using this indiscriminately.
#     -O1        if you get compile-time errors about out of memory or unable to
#                complete compilation because of complexity, try lowering the
#                optimization level on the offending source files.
#     -ipo       enable optimizations between routines in separate source files
#     -heap-arrays 10    allocate large arrays from the heap instead of putting them
#                on the stack.  the number is the limit in KB for when arrays
#                move from the stack to the heap.  this can help if you get stack
#                overflow errors and cannot increase the stack size more.
#                allocating from the stack is faster, but it's usually a smaller
#                size than the heap.
#     -x, -m, -ax, -mcode, -march   all these flags tell the compiler to generate
#                processor-specific or vector instructions.  either 'man ifort' or
#                ifort --help to see what the current list of options are and
#                which have priority over the others.
#                (for those running on yellowstone, -axavx will enable the advanced
#                vector instructions available on the sandy bridge processors.)
#     -assume buffered_io  allows the runtime library to buffer up individual
#                writes before calling the operating system.  in particular, we
#                write our observation sequence files as a series of many individual
#                calls to the write() routine.  when debugging you do not want to
#                buffer so you can see the last output before the program dies.
#                for production, however, you want to batch up writes into larger
#                blocks before stopping to do i/o to disk.  an alternative at
#                runtime is to set FORT_BUFFERED to 'true' in your environment.
#                (e.g. csh family: setenv FORT_BUFFERED true    or
#                ksh family: export FORT_BUFFERED=true).  
#
# FFLAGS   possibly useful, not normally used by DART
#     -fpp     run Fortran preprocessor on source files prior to compilation
#     -free    interpret source as free-format, regardless of file extension
#     -r8      specify default real size.  note that for DART we use explicit
#              types on all our real values so this will not change anything
#              inside DART.   see DART/common/types_mod.f90 if you must run
#              with single precision reals.
#     -convert big_endian         useful if you're on the wrong architecture.
#              however this controls both reading and writing so you can't
#              use it as a conversion mechanism unless you write files out
#              in ascii format.  applies to all unformatted fortran i/o.
#     -assume  byterecl ... more 'industry-standard' direct-access behavior
#              controls what units the RECL (record length) specifier returns.
#
# Runtime environment variables that influence the compiler behavior:
#
# Make output lines for fortran write statements longer without wrapping:
#   setenv FORT_FMT_RECL 512  (or any length)

# DISCUSSION ABOUT RTTOV. DART is designed to work with RTTOV v12.3.
# There have been non-backwards compatible changes throughout the 
# life-cycle of RTTOV (and more to be expected), so changing the
# RTTOV version will required additional effort to get running.
# You should install RTTOV 12.3 with HDF support. See 
# https://www.nwpsaf.eu/site/software/rttov/
# for more information on installing RTTOV.

# MODIFY THE FOLLOWING VARIABLES FOR YOUR SYSTEM:
# If your NETCDF, HDFEOS5, or RTTOV environment variables are not set,
# uncomment the following line and set value to where lib and include
# are found for the netcdf files that match this compiler.
# Since netCDF can be built with HDF5, many systems have the HDF5
# installation in the same place as netCDF.
#
# NETCDF = /opt/local
# HDFEOS5 = $(NETCDF)
# RTTOV = ~/research/satellite/rttov

HDFEOS5 = /glade/u/apps/ch/opt/hdf-eos5/5.1.16/intel/19.0.5

# You will likely not need to modify below this line
