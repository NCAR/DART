Data assimilation can help us create the best available representation of the state of Earth, but it requires relevant observations and a forecast model which represents all of the components of interest.</description></item><item><title>Model for Prediction across Scales</title><link>https://dart.ucar.edu/research/mpas/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Dec 2019 15:44:46 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://dart.ucar.edu/research/mpas/</guid><description>Data assimilation for MPAS is available as an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) implemented through Data Assimilation Research Testbed
