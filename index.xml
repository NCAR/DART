Assimilation Research Testbed (DART), can trace their lineage to the Kalman
filter (Kalman, 1960) which was developed for aerospace applications in the
1960’s. The Kalman filter uses a single mathematical model to represent how the
state of the dynamical system evolves over time and a covariance matrix to
represent the uncertainty in the estimation of the system’s state. Measurements
from sensors, which inherently contain errors, are incorporated in a manner
that minimizes mean squared error of the estimated state, given a linear model
and Gaussian errors. The Kalman Filter was used to estimate the trajectory of
spacecraft using measurements from onboard sensors and was incorporated into
the guidance system for the Apollo program, helping NASA astronauts
successfully land on the moon and return home safely.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Better Scientific Software with Helen Kershaw</title><link>https://dart.ucar.edu/research/code-review-better-scientific-software/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 14:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://dart.ucar.edu/research/code-review-better-scientific-software/</guid><description>&lt;p>Perhaps the rapper Childish Gambino summed it up best, “Because the internet,

&lt;p>DART_LAB is a MATLAB®-based tutorial to demonstrate the principles of
ensemble data assimilation. This tutorial begins at a more introductory level
than the materials in the tutorial directory, and includes hands-on exercises
at several points. In a workshop setting, these materials and exercises took
about 1.5 days to complete.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The DART tutorial</title><link>https://dart.ucar.edu/tutorials/dart-tutorial/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Dec 2019 13:32:54 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://dart.ucar.edu/tutorials/dart-tutorial/</guid><description>&lt;p>The DART Tutorial is intended to aid in the understanding of ensemble data assimilation

&lt;p>The WRF-DART tutorial steps through a WRF-DART experiment.
The experiment covers the continental United States and uses a 50 member ensemble initialized from
NCEP’s Global Forecast System (GFS) initial conditions at 2017/04/27 00:00 UTC.
The data included in the tutorial covers up to 2017/04/30 18:00 UTC.
During this period, there was a strong rain and wind event that affected a large portion of
the United States, causing &lt;strong>record rains&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>localized flooding&lt;/strong>, and numerous &lt;strong>tornadoes&lt;/strong>.

diagnostic steps required for a simple global assimilation run using CLM5. It is intended
to be performed after the completion of the more general
&lt;a href="https://docs.dart.ucar.edu/en/stable/theory/readme.html">DART tutorial&lt;/a> which covers the
fundamental concepts of the Ensemble Kalman Filter used within DART. This tutorial
provides fundamental concepts unique to a CLM assimilation, and offers some guidance
to set up a custom CLM assimilation to suite the user&amp;rsquo;s own research needs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Moha Gharamti Named to Boulder 40 Under Forty</title><link>https://dart.ucar.edu/research/bizwest-40-under-forty/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Sep 2023 14:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://dart.ucar.edu/research/bizwest-40-under-forty/</guid><description>&lt;p>NCAR Scientist Moha Gharamti, PhD, was recognized as one of the 40 Under Forty

atmosphere, land, ocean, cryosphere, biosphere, et cetera (Fig. 1). Data
assimilation can help us create the best available representation of the state

and magnetosphere data. We will also optimize model parameters by including
them into the state vector.
This will improve model accuracy even when no data are assimilated.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Predicting Floods and Protecting Lives</title><link>https://dart.ucar.edu/research/wrf-hydro/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 14:58:06 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://dart.ucar.edu/research/wrf-hydro/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hurricanes are among the deadliest weather phenomena on earth.

Ponce de Leon&amp;rsquo;s expedition to Florida in 1513. It is an intense oceanic flow
that runs northward along the U.S. Eastern Seaboard. The Gulf Stream gets its
name because it begins in the Gulf of Mexico where it runs westward between the
Yucatan Peninsula and Cuba before curving back east and passing south of
Florida into the Atlantic Ocean. The Gulf Stream exhibits its greatest
variability at its origin in the Gulf of Mexico and it is here that scientists
are using the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) to better predict it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Next-Generation Space Weather Prediction</title><link>https://dart.ucar.edu/research/aether/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Dec 2020 14:58:06 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://dart.ucar.edu/research/aether/</guid><description>&lt;p>Space weather events can wreak widespread societal havoc, disabling satellites

&lt;p>A long-term goal of this work is to find an efficient system for probabilistic
planetary boundary layer (PBL) nowcasting that can be employed wherever
surface observations are present. One approach showing promise is the use
of a single column model (SCM) and ensemble filter data assimilation techniques.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Assimilation on Mars</title><link>https://dart.ucar.edu/research/mars/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Feb 2021 14:54:01 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://dart.ucar.edu/research/mars/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

initial condition errors affect a forecast and where to gather additional
observations to reduce forecast errors. Most sensitivity studies use the
adjoint of a linearized forecast model to determine the gradient of a
forecast metric with respect to the initial conditions. Adjoints suffer
from a number of difficulties including coding, linearity assumptions,
and moist processes. Ensemble-based sensitivity analysis provides an
attractive alternative to adjoint-based methods because it combines data
assimilation and sensitivity analysis in a consistent manner. This image
illustrates the effect of zonal winds aloft on the position of Hurricane Katrina.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Inertio Gravity Waves</title><link>https://dart.ucar.edu/research/inertio-gravity-waves/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Feb 2021 14:58:06 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://dart.ucar.edu/research/inertio-gravity-waves/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This project aims at quantifying the impact of various motion
types in analysis and forecast fields by using normal modes.
The DART/CAM is the main analysis system used in the project.
The first question addressed is about how large part of the
atmospheric energy is associated with the inertio-gravity motions,
an important part of the global circulation primarily because of&lt;br>
their role in the tropical system.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
