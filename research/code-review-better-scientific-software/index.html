mistakes are forever.” In an age where everything online is seemingly stored
permanently for everyone to view, it can be daunting for budding software
developers to post code into an open-source repository for review.</p><p>Helen Kershaw, NSF NCAR senior software engineer who develops the Data
Assimilation Research Testbed (DART), noticed fairly early on in her career
that there can be a certain level of apprehension when software developers
contribute code to an open-source project. “I think there are two connected
difficulties that people have with the code review process. First is showing
their code. People will explain a scientific idea with a sketch on a
whiteboard, or a napkin no problem. But when it comes to code, there is a real
tendency to keep it hidden,” said Kershaw.</p><p>Code is often shared on open-source repository websites such as
<a href=http://Github.com>Github.com</a>. Github’s mechanics include creating issues
that describe why new code is necessary, pull requests that inquire whether the
new code can be merged into preexisting code, and critiques that include
comments and suggestions that should be responded to before the new code is
merged into an existing code repository.</p><p>Kershaw continued, “You might have heard people say, ‘oh I need to polish this
before I show it to you.’ There is some psychological effect behind this, and
it would be great to change this and get people showing even pseudo code to
each other. Second, people will often put a lot of time and effort in before
sharing their work, and submitting a pull request is when they are ‘done’. This
leads to a situation where the pull request is the end of work for the
contributor, but the beginning for the reviewer, so you can instantly end up in
a situation that feels like a conflict.”</p><p>To help address these issues, Kershaw was selected as one of six recipients of
the <a href=https://bssw.io/pages/bssw-fellowship-program>2023 Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellowship</a>.
The BSSw Fellowship Program aims to, “foster and promote practices, processes,
and tools to improve developer productivity and software sustainability of
scientific codes.” It funds activities that contribute toward the goal of
promoting better scientific software by creating an enduring resource available
to the community.</p><p>Kershaw’s BSSw project created a code review tutorial, viewable at
<a href=https://code-review.org/>code-review.org</a>, that can be completed by
individuals or teams of two. The aim of the tutorial is to help its users
become more comfortable with code review by practicing using the git utility
and Github. Users are asked to think critically about whether their solutions
are suitable to address the problem at hand and are tasked with making sure
their pull requests are comprehensible by others reviewing the code.</p><p>Before her current role as senior software engineer for DART, Kershaw worked at
Brown University’s Center for Computation and Visualization (CCV) where she
provided support to university researchers, including both faculty and
students. “Working at CCV was a great experience because in a support role
people often are coming to you with a problem: they may be quite (very)
frustrated already, but they are open to help,” said Kershaw. “So you have to
build rapport, team up to work out what problem you are trying to solve, how
you’re going to solve it, and what a good solution looks like. With budding
software engineers, you want to line up what they are getting out of the
project – a skill, an experience – with what you need as a
maintainer/supervisor/mentor.”</p><p>Kershaw continues her mentorship work at NSF NCAR with the Summer Internships
in Parallel Computational Science (SIParCS) program. “Working with students
requires a balance between getting quality work from them, and the students
finding benefit in this work and progressing their career. And part of making
an internship a positive experience is to communicate about what the student
wants to get out of the project. What do they want to learn, get experience in,
takeaway?” said Kershaw.</p><p>The <a href=https://code-review.org/>code-review.org</a> tutorial is used to onboard new
staff, including interns in the SIParCS program. Starting with a basic level of
comfort with the code review process can help interns to grow into their roles
and achieve great results over the course of a summer. “Ideally you can build
up small successes that can be extended to a larger project. If you have an
interesting project that you’re driving the direction of, it is an engaging way
to learn,” Kershaw continued.</p><p>Although the BSSw fellowship program is sponsored by the U.S. Department of
Energy and U.S. National Science Foundation, focusing on open-source code
review using Github broadens the potential audience. Said Kershaw, “There is so
much code available to browse, read, and try out. And the review process being
public and asynchronous: you can take a look at pull requests: How does this
work? Why did they do this? What could they have done better? You can be
anywhere in the world and get involved.”</p></div><div class="col-lg-4 mx-auto"><a href=https://dart.ucar.edu/images/featured-articles/helen-kershaw.jpg><img class=img-fluid src=https://dart.ucar.edu/images/featured-articles/helen-kershaw.jpg></a><p>Helen Kershaw at the UCAR Center Green Campus.</p></div></div></div></section></main><footer class=site-footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-2 col-md-4"><div class=site-footer-widget><h5 class=site-footer-widget-title>Contact Info</h5><p class=site-footer-widget-description>1850 Table Mesa Dr.<br>Boulder, CO 80305<br><br><a href=mailto:dart@ucar.edu>dart@ucar.edu</a></p></div></div><div class="col-lg-2 col-md-4"><div class=site-footer-widget><h5 class=site-footer-widget-title>Sitemap</h5><ul class=site-footer-widget-links><li><a href=https://dart.ucar.edu/about>About Us</a></li><li><a href=https://dart.ucar.edu/videos>Videos</a></li><li><a href=https://dart.ucar.edu/tutorials>Tutorials</a></li><li><a href=https://dart.ucar.edu/contact>Contact</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="col-lg-2 col-md-4"><div class=site-footer-widget><h5 class=site-footer-widget-title>Research</h5><ul class=site-footer-widget-links><li><a href=https://dart.ucar.edu/research>Featured Projects</a></li><li><a href=https://dart.ucar.edu/publications>Publications</a></li><li><a href=https://dart.ucar.edu/presentations>Presentations</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"><div class=site-footer-nsf>This material is based upon work supported by the NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research, a major facility sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation and managed by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research.
