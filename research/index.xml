The intensity of a hurricane is often categorized using the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, ranging between 1 to 5.</description></item><item><title>GPS RO Observations and Tropical Cyclone Forecasting</title><link>https://dart.ucar.edu/research/gps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Dec 2019 15:44:46 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://dart.ucar.edu/research/gps/</guid><description>Profiles of atmospheric quantities deduced from GPS Radio Occultation data are available in otherwise data-sparse regions and provide information used to forecast the behavior of tropical cyclones.</description></item><item><title>The Lorenz '96 model</title><link>https://dart.ucar.edu/research/lorenz_96/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Feb 2021 15:08:08 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://dart.ucar.edu/research/lorenz_96/</guid><description>The Lorenz &amp;lsquo;96 model is one of our favorite models. In our implementation, it is a 40-variable model that can be used to test inflation algorithms, the effects of localization schemes, the integrity of the DART installation itself, the state-space diagnostic routines; it is extensively used in the tutorial, and can even be run as a standalone executable to test the MPI support on a machine.</description></item><item><title>Planetary Boundary Layer</title><link>https://dart.ucar.edu/research/planetary-boundary-layer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Feb 2021 15:03:37 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://dart.ucar.edu/research/planetary-boundary-layer/</guid><description>A long-term goal of this work is to find an efficient system for probabilistic planetary boundary layer (PBL) nowcasting that can be employed wherever surface observations are present.</description></item><item><title>Assimilation on Mars</title><link>https://dart.ucar.edu/research/mars/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Feb 2021 14:54:01 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://dart.ucar.edu/research/mars/</guid><description>The planetary atmospheres group at Caltech has produced a global and planetary version of NCAR&amp;rsquo;s Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model.
