Controlling probit probability integral transform
==================================================

The QCEFF file controls:
#. What PPI transforms are used when updating state variables,
#. What PPI transforms are used when updating extended state variables (observations), 
#. What PPI transforms are used before applying inflation,
#. What distribution is used for observational error distributions,
#. What distribution is used to fit the prior in observation space. 

However, for most applications of DART, the same transforms and distributions are appropriate 
for all five of these choices. 

See the DART website for more information. (Helen, link to the QCEFF table stuff?)
