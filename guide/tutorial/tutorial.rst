DART Tutorial
================

This section describes some basic features of the Data Assimilation Research Testbed Community Software Facility.

It assumes a familiarity with the ensemble DA concepts that are introduced in the first 5 sections. In particular, 
this section begins by describing how to reproduce all the capabilities of the Lorenz-96 model matlab GUIs using the DART facility.  

It also describes a few additional capabilities of DART. Examples are provided using the Lorenz-96 model. 

Additional tutorial material is also available for the use of DART with some specific large geophysical models like 
WRF, CAM, and MPAS. (Helen, include links?)
