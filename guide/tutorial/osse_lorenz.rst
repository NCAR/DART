An OSSE with Lorenz_96
=======================================


An Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) generates synthetic observations of a model time integration. 

In earlier DART_LAB sections, the run_lorenz_96 gui generated an OSSE by running Lorenz_96. Synthetic observations 
were generated by adding a random draw from a specificed observation error distribution to selected model state variables 
at each assimilation time.These observations were then assimilated using ensemble filters.

The DART program perfect_model_obs is used to generate the synthetic observations from a model integration.

The DART program filter performs an ensemble assimilation that ingests observations generated by perfect_model_obs.

To do an example OSSE with DART, run the program perfect_model_obs followed by filter.
