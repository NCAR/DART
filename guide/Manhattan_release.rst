DART Manhattan release documentation
------------------------------------

DART overview
-------------

The Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) is designed to facilitate the combination of assimilation algorithms,
models, and real (or synthetic) observations to allow increased understanding of all three. The DART programs are highly
portable, having been compiled with many Fortran 90 compilers and run on linux compute-servers, linux clusters, OSX
laptops/desktops, SGI Altix clusters, supercomputers running AIX, and more. Read the
:doc:`./compiling-dart` section for help in
building on new platforms.

DART employs a modular programming approach to apply an Ensemble Kalman Filter which adjusts model values toward a state
that is more consistent with information from a set of observations. Models may be swapped in and out, as can different
algorithms in the Ensemble Kalman Filter. The method requires running multiple instances of a model to generate an
ensemble of states. A forward operator appropriate for the type of observation being assimilated is applied to each of
the states to generate the model's estimate of the observation. Comparing these estimates and their uncertainty to the
observation and its uncertainty ultimately results in the adjustments to the model states. See the
:doc:`DART_LAB/DART_LAB` demos or read more :ref:`_DARTtutorial.

DART diagnostic output can be written that contains the model state before and after the adjustment, along with the
ensemble mean and standard deviation, and prior or posterior inflation values if inflation is enabled. There is also a
text file, ``obs_seq.final``, with the model estimates of the observations. There is a suite of MATLABÂ® functions that
facilitate exploration of the results, but the netCDF files are inherently portable and contain all the necessary
metadata to interpret the contents with other analysis programs such as NCL, R, etc.


Notes for current users
-----------------------

If you have been updating from the rma_trunk branch of the DART subversion repository you will notice that the code tree
has been simplified to be more intuitive for users. The new top level directory structure looks like :

-  ``README``
-  ``COPYRIGHT``
-  *assimilation_code*
-  *build_templates*
-  *diagnostics*
-  *documentation*
-  *models*
-  *observations*

if you do try to do an 'svn update' on an existing directory, you will encounter many 'tree conflicts'.

We suggest that current users checkout a fresh version of Manhattan in a new location. To see which files need to be
moved, run 'svn status' on your original checked out version. Anything with an M or ? in the first column needs to be
moved to the new location in the new tree. Please `contact <mailto:dart@ucar.edu>`__ DART if you have any issues
migrating your existing code to the new tree structure.

There is a list of non-backwards compatible changes (see below), and a list of new options and functions.

The Manhattan release will continue to be updated for the next few months as we continue to add features. Checking out
the Manhattan release branch and running 'svn update' from time to time is the recommended way to update your DART tree.

Non-backwards compatible changes
--------------------------------

Unlike previous releases of DART, this version contains more non-backwards compatible changes than usual. Please examine
the following list carefully. We do suggest you check out the Manhattan release into a new location and migrate any
local changes from previous versions as a second step.

Changes in the Manhattan release (15 May 2015) which are *not* backwards compatible with the Lanai release (13 Dec
2013):

#. We no longer require model data to be converted to DART format restart files. We directly read and write NetCDF
   format only. To specify the input and output files for filter, there are new namelist items in the &filter_nml
   namelist: ``'input_state_file_list'`` and ``'output_state_file_list'`` .

#. The information formerly in ``Prior_Diag.nc`` and ``Posterior_Diag.nc`` has been moved. If you are reading and
   writing ensemble members from different files, the state information, the ensemble mean and standard deviation, and
   the inflation mean and standard deviation will all be read and written to separate files:

   -  ``[stage]_member_####.nc``
   -  ``[stage]_mean.nc``
   -  ``[stage]_sd.nc``
   -  ``[stage]_priorinf_{mean,sd}.nc`` (if prior inflation is turned on)
   -  ``[stage]_postinf_{mean,sd}.nc`` (if posterior inflation is turned on)

   If you are reading and writing ensemble members from a single file, all this information will now be in a single
   NetCDF file but will be stored in different variables inside that file:

   -  ``[var].nc``
   -  ``[var]_mean.nc``
   -  ``[var]_sd.nc``
   -  ``[var]_priorinf_{mean,sd}.nc`` (if prior inflation is turned on)
   -  ``[var]_postinf_{mean,sd}.nc`` (if posterior inflation is turned on)

   We also now have options for writing files at six stages of the assimilation cycle:
   ``'input', 'forecast', 'preassim', 'postassim', 'analysis', 'output'``.
   This is set in the &filter_nml namelist with stages_to_write.

#. New model_mod.f90 required routines:

   -  ``vert_convert()``
   -  ``query_vert_localization_coord()``
   -  ``pert_model_copies()``
   -  ``read_model_time()``
   -  ``write_model_time()``

   There are default version of these available to use if you have no special requirements.

#. Several of the model_mod.f90 argument lists have changed

   -  ``model_interpolate()`` now takes in the ``state_handle`` as an argument rather than a state vector array. It also
      return an array of ``expected_obs`` and ``istatus`` for each of the ensemble members
   -  ``get_state_meta_data()`` also requires the ``state_handle`` as an argument rather than a state vector array.
   -  ``nc_write_model_atts()`` has an additional argument ``moel_mod_writes_state_variables``. If true then the
      model_mod is expected to write out the state variables, if false DART will write out the state variable (this is
      the prefered method for adding new models, it requires less code from the model developer)

#. There are several namelist changes mainly in the &filter_nml and &perfect_model_mod which are outlined in detail in
   :doc:`./Manhattan_diffs_from_Lanai`

#. All modules have been moved to *DART/assimilation_code/modules/* directory. And similarly all of the programs have
   moved to *DART/assimilation_code/programs/*

#. The location modules which were stored in *locations* have moved to *DART/assimilation_code/location* directory

#. The observation converters which were stored in *observations* have moved to *DART/observations/obs_converters*
   directory

#. The forward operators have moved from *obs_def/obs_def_*_mod.f90* to *observations/forward_operators*

#. The tutorial files have moved to *DART/docs/tutorial directory*

#. The program ``fill_inflation_restart`` can be used to create initial inflation restart files for the first assimilation step in a multi-step assimilation.  This allows the scripting to treat the first step the same as subsequent steps for inflation file motion and namelist settings.

#. The default flags in the mkmf_template.XXX files have been updated to be more consistent with current compiler
   versions.

#. If you enable the sampling error correction option, the required data is now read from a single netcdf file which
   supports multiple ensemble sizes. A program is provided to compute additional ensemble sizes if they are not in the
   default file.

#. Our use of TYPES and KINDS has been very confusing in the past. In Manhattan we have tried to make it clearer which
   things in DART are generic quantities (QTY) - temperature, pressure, etc - and which things are specific types of
   observations - Radiosonde_temperature, Argo_salinity etc.

   Below is a mapping between old and new subroutine names here for reference. We have made these changes to all files
   distributed with DART. If you have lots of code developed outside of the subversion repository, please contact
   `DART <mailto:dart@ucar.edu>`__ for a sed script to help automate the changes.

         max_obs_generic  =>  max_defined_quantities  (not currently public, stays private)
         max_obs_kinds    =>  max_defined_types_of_obs 

#. For smaller models we support single file input and output. These files contain all of the member information, mean,
   standard deviation and inflation values for all of the state variables. This can be run with cycling and all time
   steps will be appended to the file.

   For ``perfect_model_obs`` we provide a ``perfect_input.cdl`` file which contains a single ensemble member which will
   be considered the 'truth' and observations will be generated based on those values. The output will contain all of
   the cycling timesteps all of the state variables.

   For ``filter`` we provide a ``filter_input.cdl`` file which contains all of the state member variables and
   potentially inflation mean and standard deviation values. The output will contain all of the cycling timesteps all of
   the state variables. Additionally you have the option to write out different stages during the assimilation in the
   &filter_nml ``stages_to_write`` mentioned above.

   To generate a NetCDF file from a .cdl file run:

   ::

         ncgen -o perfect_input.nc perfect_input.cdl
         ncgen -o filter_input.nc filter_input.cdl
         

New features
------------

-  DART now reads and writes NetCDF files for the model state information. If your model uses NetCDF file format, you no
   longer need model_to_dart or dart_to_model to translate to a DART format file. If your model does not use NetCDF, you
   can adapt your model_to_dart and dart_to_model executables to read and write a NetCDF file for DART to use. The
   read/write code is part of the core DART routines so no code is needed in the model_mod model-specific module. There
   is a new routine :doc:`./state_structure` that a model_mod::static_init_model() can user to define which NetCDF
   variables should be part of the model state, and what DART quantity (formerly kind) they correspond to.
-  DART no longer limits the size of a model state to the size of a single MPI task's memory. The state is read in
   variable by variable and distributed across all MPI tasks, so the memory use is much smaller than previous versions
   of DART. One-sided MPI communication is used during the computation of forward operator values to get required parts
   of the state from other tasks.
-  Many of the DART namelists have been simplified, and some items have moved to a more specific namelist.
-  Observation sequence files can include externally computed forward operator values which can be used in the
   assimilation instead of calling a forward operator inside DART.
-  The DART directory structure has been reorganized to make it easier to identify the various software tools, modules,
   documentation and tutorials supplied with the system.
-  The MATLABÂ® diagnostic routines have been updated to not require the MEXNC toolbox. These routines use the built-in
   NetCDF support that comes with MATLABÂ®.
-  There is a new Particle Filter type. Please contact us if you are interested in using it.
-  DART can now take subsets of observation types and restrict them from impacting certain quantities in the state
   during the assimilation. A tool to simplify constructing the table of interactions is provided (obs_impact_tool).
-  State Structure

   -  Contains information about dimensions and size of variables in your state. There is a number of accessor functions
      to get variable information such as ``get_variable_size()``. See the :doc:`./state_structure` for more details.

-  The POP model_mod now can interpolate Sea Surface Anomaly observations.

Changed models
--------------

-  WRF

   -  Allow advanced microphysics schemes (needed interpolation for 7 new kinds)
   -  Interpolation in the vertical is now done in log(p) instead of linear pressure space. log(p) is the default, but a
      compile-time variable can restore the linear interpolation.
   -  Added support in the namelist to avoid writing updated fields back into the wrf netcdf files. The fields are still
      updated during the assimilation but the updated data is not written back to the wrfinput file during the
      dart_to_wrf step.
   -  Fixed an obscure bug in the vertical convert routine of the wrf model_mod that would occasionally fail to convert
      an obs. This would make tiny differences in the output as the number of mpi tasks change. No quantitative
      differences in the results but they were not bitwise compatible before and they are again now.

-  CAM

   -  DART/CAM now runs under the CESM framework, so all options available with the framework can be used.
   -  Support for the SE core (HOMME) has been developed but is NOT part of this release. Please contact the `DART
      Development Group <mailto:dart@ucar.edu>`__ if you have an interest in this configuration of CAM.

-  Simple Advection Model

   -  Fixed a bug where the random number generator was being used before being called with an initial seed.

New observation types/forward operators
---------------------------------------

-  Many new observation types related to land and atmospheric chemistry have been added. See the
   ``obs_kind_mod.f90`` for a list of the
   generic quantities now available.
-  New forward operator for Sea Ice (cice) ice thickness observations. See the
   ``obs_def_cice_mod.f90`` file for details.
-  New forward operator for Carbon Monoxide (CO) Nadir observations. See the
   ``obs_def_CO_Nadir_mod.f90`` file for details.
-  New forward operator for Total Cloud Water in a column observations. See the
   ``obs_def_cwp_mod.f90`` file for details.

New observation types/sources
-----------------------------

-  AVISO
   Added an observation converter for Sea Surface Height Anomaly observations. Documentation in
   ``convert_aviso.f90`` (source).
-  cice
   Added an obs_sequence converter for Sea Ice observations. Documentation in
   :doc:`../../observations/obs_converters/cice/cice_to_obs`.
-  GPSPW
   Added an obs_sequence converter for GPS precipitable water observations. Documentation in
   ``convert_gpspw.f90`` (source).
-  MODIS
   Added an obs_sequence converter for MODIS FPAR (Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation) and LAI (Leaf Area
   Index) obseverations. Documentation in :doc:`../../observations/obs_converters/MODIS/MOD15A2_to_obs`.
-  ok_mesonet
   Added an obs_sequence converter for the Oklahoma Mesonet observations. Documentation in
   :doc:`../../observations/obs_converters/ok_mesonet/ok_mesonet`.
-  ROMS
   Added an obs_sequence converter for ROMS ocean data. This converter includes externally computed forward operators
   output from the ROMS model using FGAT (First Guess At Time) during the model run. Documentation in
   ``convert_roms_obs.f90`` (source).
-  SSUSI
   Added an obs_sequence converter for wind profiler observations. Documentation in
   :doc:`../../observations/obs_converters/SSUSI/convert_f16_edr_dsk`.
-  tropical_cyclone
   Added an obs_sequence converter for ASCII format tropical cyclone track observations. Documentation in
   :doc:`../../observations/obs_converters/tropical_cyclone/tc_to_obs`.

New diagnostics and documentation
---------------------------------

-  The MATLABÂ® diagnostic routines have been updated to remove the dependency on third-party toolboxes. These routines
   use the built-in netCDF support that comes with basic MATLABÂ® (no other toolboxes needed).

But there's always more to add. **Please let us know where we are lacking.**

New utilities
-------------

This section describes updates and changes to the tutorial materials, scripting, setup, and build information since the
Lanai release.

-  ``obs_impact_tool`` please refer to
   or :doc:`../../assimilation_code/programs/obs_impact_tool/obs_impact_tool`
-  ``gen_sampling_error_table`` now computes sampling error correction tables for any ensemble size.
-  ``compute_error``
   or :doc:`../../assimilation_code/programs/compute_error/compute_error`
