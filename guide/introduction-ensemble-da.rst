Introduction to ensemble data assimilation
==========================================

Data assimilation is a powerful and widely used computational technique
that has many application areas throughout mathematics and science. At a
very high level, data assimilation refers to the process of merging
prior *forecasts* with new *observations*, creating a new analysis that
is an "optimal" blending of the two by taking into account their
relative uncertainties.

The following animated graphic describes the data assimilation process
at a high level:

Shown here are three ensemble members, each of which gives a different
initial prediction at the time :math:`t_k`. Moving these predictions
forward in time to :math:`t_{k+1}` will give a new forecast distribution
called a *prior*.

Suppose at this time there is also an observation, which will have some
uncertainty due to instrument noise, etc. Mapping each of the ensemble members
to the observations with a function :math:`h` and applying **Bayes' theorem**
will generate an update to the prior distribution, called here the
*state increment*. Adding the state increment to the ensemble members will give
the new *analysis* (also known as the *posterior*) at time :math:`t_{k+1}`.
This process can then be repeated for each set of observations as many times as
necessary. For an introduction to Bayes' theorem, see
:doc:`/theory/conditional-probability-bayes-theorem` in the Theory section.

Expanding on this somewhat, the :math:`ith` ensemble member is denoted
:math:`x_i` at the present time step. In the above graphic, there
were three ensemble members, but in general there are usually many more,
typically in the range of 20-1000 depending on the application. Each
member :math:`x_i` can have :math:`n` components which together make up the
**model state**. Each member contains all the variables you want to find
the best fit for at a particular time. These variables are usually
physically meaningful quantities; for example, this might include the 3D
values of water vapor, temperature, wind speed, etc. for an atmospheric
model. These values are expected to be advanced forward in time by a
model, which is why they are called the "model state."

.. note::

   In data assimilation, the "model state" is the minimum amount of information
   necessary to restart the model for a new forecast.

At any particular time step there may be :math:`m` **observations** available.
These observations are assumed to relate to the model state and provide
"real world" checks against the model forecast. A "forward operator",
represented in the above diagram by :math:`h`, is a relationship that computes
what an observation is most likely to be given a model state. In other
words, :math:`h` maps between :math:`x_i` and :math:`y_j`, giving the "expected
observation" of the :math:`jth` observation given the :math:`ith` ensemble
member. An observation may be of the same quantity as one found in the model
state at a particular location, in which case the :math:`h` function mapping
them is trivial and the comparison is simple. The vector :math:`y` may also
contain more complex derived functions of the state :math:`x` (for example,
radar observations of precipitation), in which case the :math:`h` function that
models this mapping between :math:`x` (in this example precipitation) and
:math:`y` (in this example radar returns) may be an algorithm that is quite
complicated.

In practice, observations are never 100% reliable. The observations
themselves will have some uncertainty for example arising from instrument
noise. The instrument noise error variances are typically published by the
instrument manufacturer, and these observation errors are usually assumed to be
independent as true instrument "noise" should not be correlated in time or
space. Furthermore, since models have a finite resolution (i.e. they are
"fuzzy"), there is almost always an error that arises when comparing the model
to the observations. This is called the **representativeness error**. Put
together, the potential "likelihood" of the possible values of the observation
forms the **observational error distribution** in the above graphic.

Finally, note that in real-world applications there are typically many
fewer observations than state variables, i.e. :math:`m` is typically **much
much less** than :math:`n`. In practice this means that the observations alone
cannot be relied upon to predict the model state; the ensemble approach
with Bayes' theorem is necessary.

DART makes it easy to find the optimal solution to the above problem
using an ensemble filter algorithm (the most typically used algorithm is
the **Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter**; see
:doc:`important-capabilities-dart` for more information). The user specifies
which state variables make up the :math:`x` ensemble vectors, which
observations make up the :math:`y` vector, and the observation error variances.
The ensemble of model states is assumed to be representative of the
uncertainty or spread in the model state. Finally, the user tells DART how to
advance the model from one forecast to the next. Once DART has this
information, it can proceed with optimally blending the observations and model
forecasts â€” in other words, performing data assimilation.

The spread of the **ensemble** informs DART of the **uncertainty** in the model
state. This allows for as rich, complex, and meaningful relationships as the
data contained within the ensemble itself. By default, no implicit assumptions
about the relative uncertainties are required, as the data can speak for
itself. Areas of large uncertainty will naturally have large spread, as the
ensemble members will contain very different values at those locations, while
areas of low uncertainty will naturally have low spread due to the ensemble
having relatively similar values at those locations. Furthermore, relationships
in space and between variables can also be meaningfully derived. Of course this
means that the quality of the ensemble is crucial to the success of the DA
process, as uncertainty can only be accurately quantified if the ensemble is
representative of the "true" uncertainty inherent in the system. Due to the
fact that a relatively small number of ensemble members are typically used,
estimated correlations between two distant locations may become unreliable due
to sampling error. Thus, various techniques such as **covariance localization**
may be employed to improve the quality of estimated relationships and increase
skill in prediction. Furthermore, the ensemble spread may sometimes be deemed
"too small" or "too large" by various criteria, in which case a multiplicative
or additive **inflation** or **deflation**, respectively, may be applied. In
practice the ensemble method is usually far more accurate and less error-prone
than the main alternative of manually specifying uncertainty by some
manually-designed algorithm, and it is certainly less labor-intensive to
develop.

This was a brief introduction to the important concepts of DA. For more
