A brief history of DART
=======================

The DART project was initiated in August 2001, and in 2003, the Data
Assimilation Research Section (DAReS) was officially formed at NSF NCAR. In 2004,
the first officially supported version of DART was released. Consistent version
control history is available back to 2005, making DART an extremely long-lived
and well-supported software project. Since 2004, there have been more than a
dozen releases. The first release, *Easter*, began the trend of naming the major
releases after islands in alphabetical order in the following sequence:
