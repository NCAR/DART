How DART supports different types of observations: the preprocess program
=========================================================================

DART's :doc:`preprocess program <../assimilation_code/programs/preprocess/preprocess>`
actually writes the source code that supports
observations. This source code is then used by other modules.

The rationale for ``preprocess``
--------------------------------

Certain types of data require additional metadata in order to be assimilated.
For example, while radiosondes only require the observation location in order
to be assimilated, radar observations need extra metadata to specify the
location of the radar in addition to the location of the observation. GPS
occultations need the locations of the two satellites so the forward operator
can integrate along the raypath. Cosmic ray soil moisture sensors have forward
operators that require site-specific calibration parameters that are not part
of the model and must be included in the observation metadata.

Since each observation type may require different amounts of metadata to
be read or written, any routine to read or write an observation sequence
**must** be compiled with support for those particular observations. This is
the rationale for the inclusion of ``preprocess`` in DART. The supported
observations are listed in the ``obs_kind_nml`` namelist in ``input.nml``.

For this reason, we strongly recommend that you use the DART routines to read
and process DART observation sequence files.


.. important::

    Preprocess is built and run when you run ``quickbuild.sh``

Preprocess is used to insert observation specific code into DART at compile time. 
This compile time choice is how DART can assimilate synthetic observations for the
Lorenz_63 model and real radar reflectivities for WRF without needing to specify a set of radar
operators for the Lorenz_63 model.

``preprocess`` combines multiple ``obs_def`` modules into one
``obs_def_mod.f90`` that is then used by the rest of DART. Additionally, a new
``obs_kind_mod.f90`` is built that will provide support for associating the
specific observation **TYPES** with corresponding (generic) observation
**QUANTITIES**.

The list of ``obs_def`` and ``obs_quantity`` module source codes are contained in the
``&preprocess_nml`` namelist in ``input.nml``. These modules determine what
observations and operators are supported.

.. warning::
   
   If you want to add another ``obs_def`` module or quantity file, you **must** rerun
   ``preprocess`` and recompile the rest of your project.

Example ``preprocess`` namelist
-------------------------------

As an example, if a ``preprocess_nml`` namelist in ``input.nml`` looks like:

.. code-block:: fortran

   &preprocess_nml
       input_obs_qty_mod_file  = '../../../assimilation_code/modules/observations/DEFAULT_obs_kind_mod.F90'
       output_obs_qty_mod_file = '../../../assimilation_code/modules/observations/obs_kind_mod.f90'
       quantity_files           = '../../../assimilation_code/modules/observations/atmosphere_quantities_mod.f90',
       input_obs_def_mod_file   = '../../../observations/forward_operators/DEFAULT_obs_def_mod.F90'
       obs_type_files           = '../../../observations/forward_operators/obs_def_gps_mod.f90',
                                  '../../../observations/forward_operators/obs_def_QuikSCAT_mod.f90',
                                  '../../../observations/forward_operators/obs_def_GWD_mod.f90',
                                  '../../../observations/forward_operators/obs_def_altimeter_mod.f90',
                                  '../../../observations/forward_operators/obs_def_reanalysis_bufr_mod.f90'
       output_obs_def_mod_file  = '../../../observations/forward_operators/obs_def_mod.f90'
       /

``preprocess`` will combine the following modules:

- ``DEFAULT_obs_def_mod.F90``
- ``obs_def_gps_mod.f90``
- ``obs_def_QuikSCAT_mod.f90``
- ``obs_def_GWD_mod.f90``
- ``obs_def_altimeter_mod.f90``
- and ``obs_def_reanalysis_bufr_mod.f90``
  
into ``obs_def_mod.f90``. This resulting module can be used by the rest of the
project.
