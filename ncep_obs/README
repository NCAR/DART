This directory contains source for two programs that convert NCEP BUFR files,
which contain observational data, into DART obs_seq file format.

The first is in the prep_bufr directory.  This program converts the raw
data files into an intermediate text format.  See prep_bufr/prep_bufr.html
for detailed documentation.

The second is the create_real_obs program, which has the source in
this directory but is built with scripts in the 'work' subdirectory.
It reads the intermediate text files and outputs DART obs_seq file format.
See create_real_obs.html for documentation.


7 Nov 2007:
The latest code updates to this directory are contributed by Ryan Torn
and include support for additional observation types and the option to
restrict the output to only observations in a specified lat/lon box.

The defaults have also changed in the scripts.  They will create 6 hour
observation files instead of 12.  The utility 'merge_obs_seq' can be
used to concatinate multiple observation files into daily (or longer)
files.
