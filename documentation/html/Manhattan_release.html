<h2>Dart Overview</h2>

<p>The Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) is designed to
facilitate the combination of assimilation algorithms, models,
and real (or synthetic) observations to allow
increased understanding of all three.
The DART programs are highly portable, having been
compiled with many Fortran 90 compilers
and run on linux compute-servers, linux clusters, OSX laptops/desktops,
SGI Altix clusters, supercomputers running AIX, and more.
Read the 
<a href="https://www.image.ucar.edu/DAReS/DART/DART2_Starting.php#customizations">Customizations</a> section
for help in building on new platforms.</p>

<p>
DART employs a modular programming approach to apply an Ensemble Kalman Filter
which adjusts model values toward a state that is more consistent with information
from a set of observations. Models may be swapped in and out, as can
different algorithms in the Ensemble Kalman Filter. The method
requires running multiple instances of a model to generate an ensemble of
states. A forward operator appropriate for the type of observation being assimilated
is applied to each of the states to generate the model's estimate of the observation.
Comparing these estimates and their uncertainty to the observation and
its uncertainty ultimately results in the adjustments to the model states.
See the <a href="../DART_LAB/DART_LAB.html">DART_LAB</a>
demos or read more <a href="../tutorial/index.html">in the DART tutorial</a>.
</p>

<p>DART diagnostic output can be written that contains the model
state before and after the adjustment, along with the ensemble mean
and standard deviation, and prior or posterior inflation values if inflation is enabled.
There is also a text file, <em class=file>obs_seq.final</em>, with the model estimates of the 
observations.  There is a suite of MATLAB&reg; functions that facilitate exploration of the
results, but the netCDF files are inherently portable and contain all the
necessary metadata to interpret the contents with other analysis programs
such as NCL, R, etc.

<h2>Notes for Current Users</h2>

<p>
If you have been updating from the rma_trunk branch of the DART subversion
repository you will notice that the code tree has been simplified to be more
intuitive for users. The new top level directory structure looks like :

  <ul><li> <em class=file>README</em>            </li>
      <li> <em class=file>COPYRIGHT</em>         </li>
      <li> <em class=dir >assimilation_code</em> </li>
      <li> <em class=dir >build_templates</em>   </li>
      <li> <em class=dir >diagnostics</em>       </li>
      <li> <em class=dir >documentation</em>     </li>
      <li> <em class=dir >models</em>            </li>
      <li> <em class=dir >observations</em>      </li>
  </ul>

if you do try to do an 'svn update' on an existing directory, you will
encounter many 'tree conflicts'.

<p>
We suggest that current users checkout a fresh version of Manhattan in
a new location.
To see which files need to be moved, run 'svn status' on your original
checked out version.
Anything with an M or ? in the first column needs to be moved
to the new location in the new tree.  Please <a href="mailto:dart@ucar.edu">contact</a>
DART if you have any issues migrating your existing code to the new tree structure.
</p>

<p>
There is a list of non-backwards compatible changes
(<a href="#Nonbackward">see below</a>), and a list
of new options and functions.
</p>

<p>
The Manhattan release will continue to be updated for the next few months
as we continue to add features.  
Checking out the Manhattan release branch and running 'svn update'
from time to time is the recommended way to update your DART tree.
</p>

<h2>Non-backwards Compatible Changes</h2>

<p>Unlike previous releases of DART, this version contains
more non-backwards compatible changes than usual.  Please examine the
following list carefully.  We do suggest you check out the Manhattan
release into a new location and migrate any local changes from previous
versions as a second step.
</p>

<p>
Changes in the Manhattan release (15 May 2015) which are <em>not</em> backwards compatible
with the Lanai release (13 Dec 2013):
</p>

<ol>

<li> 
We no longer require model data to be converted to DART format restart files.
We directly read and write NetCDF format only.  To specify the input and output
files for filter, there are new namelist items in the &filter_nml namelist:
<code>'input_state_file_list'</code> and <code>'output_state_file_list'</code> .
</li>

<li> 
The information formerly in
<em class=file>Prior_Diag.nc</em> and <em class=file> Posterior_Diag.nc</em> 
has been moved.  If you are reading and writing ensemble members from
different files, the state information, the ensemble mean and standard deviation,
and the inflation mean and standard deviation will all be read and written to
separate files:  
  <ul><li> <em class=file>[stage]_member_####.nc</em></li>
      <li> <em class=file>[stage]_mean.nc</em></li>
      <li> <em class=file>[stage]_sd.nc</em></li>
      <li> <em class=file>[stage]_priorinf_{mean,sd}.nc</em> (if prior inflation is turned on)</li>
      <li> <em class=file>[stage]_postinf_{mean,sd}.nc</em>  (if posterior inflation is turned on)</li>
  </ul>

<br />
If you are reading and writing ensemble members from a
single file, all this information will now be in a single NetCDF file but
will be stored in different variables inside that file:
  <ul><li> <em class=file>[var].nc</em></li>
      <li> <em class=file>[var]_mean.nc</em></li>
      <li> <em class=file>[var]_sd.nc</em></li>
      <li> <em class=file>[var]_priorinf_{mean,sd}.nc</em> (if prior inflation is turned on)</li>
      <li> <em class=file>[var]_postinf_{mean,sd}.nc</em>  (if posterior inflation is turned on)</li>
  </ul>
<br />
We also now have options for writing files at four stages of the 
assimilation cycle:
<code>'input', 'preassim', 'postassim', 'output'</code>. 
This is set in the &amp;filter_nml  namelist with stages_to_write. 
</li>


<li> New model_mod.f90 required routines:
    <ul><li> <em class=code>vert_convert()</em></li>
        <li> <em class=code>query_vert_localization_coord()</em></li>
        <li> <em class=code>pert_model_copies()</em></li>
        <li> <em class=code>read_model_time()</em></li>
        <li> <em class=code>write_model_time()</em></li></ul>
     There are default version of these available to use if you have
     no special requirements.
</li>

<li> Several of the model_mod.f90 argument lists have changed
    <ul><li> <em class=code>model_interpolate()</em> now takes in
             the <code>state_handle</code> as an argument rather than
             a state vector array.  It also return an array of
             <code>expected_obs</code> and <code>istatus</code> for
             each of the ensemble members</li>
        <li> <em class=code>get_state_meta_data()</em> also requires
             the <code>state_handle</code> as an argument rather than
             a state vector array.</li>
        <li> <em class=code>nc_write_model_atts()</em> has an additional
             argument <code>moel_mod_writes_state_variables</code>. If
             true then the model_mod is expected to write out the state variables,
             if false DART will write out the state variable (this is the prefered
             method for adding new models, it requires less code from the model
             developer)</li></ul>
</li>


<li>
There are several namelist changes mainly in the &amp;filter_nml and 
&amp;perfect_model_mod which are outlined in detail in 
<a href="Manhattan_diffs_from_Lanai.html">Manhattan_diffs_from_Lanai</a>
</li>

<li> 
     All modules have been moved to 
     <em class=dir>DART/assimilation_code/modules/</em> 
     directory. And similarly all of the programs have moved to 
     <em class=dir>DART/assimilation_code/programs/</em>
</li>

<li>
    The location modules which were stored in <em class=dir>locations</em> 
    have moved to <em class=dir>DART/assimilation_code/location</em> 
    directory
</li>

<li>
    The observation converters which were stored in <em class=dir>observations</em> 
    have moved to <em class=dir>DART/observations/obs_converters</em> 
    directory
</li>

<li>
    The forward operators have moved from <em class=dir>obs_def/obs_def_*_mod.f90</em> to
    <em class=dir>observations/forward_operators</em>
</li>

<li>
    The tutorial files have moved to 
    <em class=dir>DART/documentation/tutorial directory</em>
</li>

<li>
   The program <em class=file>fill_inflation_restart</em> is OBSOLETE since
   DART inflation files are now in NetCDF format. Now inflation files can be filled
   using <em class=program>ncap2</em>.  Here is an example using version 4.4.2 or later
   of the NCO tools:
<pre>
  ncap2 -s "T=1.0;U=1.0;V=1.0" wrfinput_d01 prior_inf.nc'
  ncap2 -s "T=0.6;U=0.6;V=0.6" wrfinput_d01 prior_sd.nc'
</pre>
</li>

<li>
   The default flags in the mkmf_template.XXX files have been updated to
   be more consistent with current compiler versions.</li>
</li>

<li>If you enable the sampling error correction option, the required
data is now read from a single netcdf file which supports multiple
ensemble sizes.  A program is provided to compute additional ensemble
sizes if they are not in the default file.
</li> 


<li>
<p>
Our use of TYPES and KINDS has been very confusing in
the past.  In Manhattan we have tried  to make it clearer 
which things in DART are generic quantities (QTY) - temperature, 
pressure, etc - and which things are specific types of 
observations - Radiosonde_temperature, Argo_salinity etc.
</p>

<p>
Below is a mapping between old and new subroutine names
here for reference.   We have made these changes to all files
distributed with DART.
If you have lots of code developed outside of the subversion
repository, please contact 
<a href="mailto:dart@ucar.edu">DART</a> for a sed script to 
help automate the changes. 
</p>

Public subroutines, existing name on left, replacement on right:

<pre>
    
    assimilate_this_obs_kind()     =&gt;     assimilate_this_type_of_obs(type_index)
    evaluate_this_obs_kind()       =&gt;       evaluate_this_type_of_obs(type_index)
    use_ext_prior_this_obs_kind()  =&gt;  use_ext_prior_this_type_of_obs(type_index)
    
    get_num_obs_kinds()            =&gt;  get_num_types_of_obs()

    write_obs_kind()               =&gt;  write_type_of_obs_table(file_unit, file_format)
    
    maps obs_seq nums to specific type nums, only used in read_obs_seq:
    map_def_index()                =&gt; map_type_of_obs_table()
    
    removed this.  apparently unused, and simply calls get_obs_kind_name():
    get_obs_name()
    
    apparently unused anywhere, removed:
    add_wind_names()
    do_obs_form_pair()
</pre>

Public integer parameter constants and subroutine formal argument names,
old on left, new on right:

<pre>

   KIND_ =&gt; QTY_
   kind  =&gt; quantity
   
   TYPE_ =&gt; TYPE_
   type  =&gt; type_of_obs
   
   integer parameters:
   max_obs_generic  =&gt;  max_defined_quantities  (not currently public, stays private)
   max_obs_kinds    =&gt;  max_defined_types_of_obs 
</pre>
</li>

<li>
   For smaller models we support single file input and output.  These files contain all of 
   the member information, mean, standard deviation and inflation values for all of the
   state variables.  This can be run with cycling and all time steps will be appended 
   to the file.

   <p>
   For <em class=program>perfect_model_obs</em> we provide a 
   <em class=file>perfect_input.cdl</em> file which contains a single ensemble member
   which will be considered the 'truth' and observations will be generated based on
   those values. The output will contain all of the cycling timesteps all of the state
   variables.
   </p>

   <p>
   For <em class=program>filter</em> we provide a 
   <em class=file>filter_input.cdl</em> file which contains all of the state member 
   variables and potentially inflation mean and standard deviation values. The 
   output will contain all of the cycling timesteps all of the state variables.
   Additionally you have the option to write out different stages during the
   assimilation in the &amp;filter_nml <code>stages_to_write</code> mentioned above.
   </p>

   <p>
   To generate a NetCDF file from a .cdl file run:
   <pre>
   ncgen -o perfect_input.nc perfect_input.cdl
   ncgen -o filter_input.nc filter_input.cdl
   </pre>
   </p>
</li>

</ol>

<a name="NewFeatures"></a>
<div class="top">[<a href="#">top</a>]</div><hr />
<h2>New Features</h2>

<ul>

<li>DART now reads and writes NetCDF files for the model state information.
If your model uses NetCDF file format, you no longer need model_to_dart or
dart_to_model to translate to a DART format file.  If your model does not
use NetCDF, you can adapt your model_to_dart and dart_to_model executables
to read and write a NetCDF file for DART to use.<br />
<br />
The read/write code is part of the core DART routines so no code is needed
in the model_mod model-specific module.  There is a new routine 
<a href="state_structure.html">add_domain()</a>
that a model_mod::static_init_model() can user to define which NetCDF variables
should be part of the model state, and what DART quantity (formerly kind) they
correspond to.
</li>
<br /> 

<li>DART no longer limits the size of a model state to the size of a single
MPI task's memory.  The state is read in variable by variable and distributed
across all MPI tasks, so the memory use is much smaller than previous versions
of DART.  One-sided MPI communication is used during the computation of
forward operator values to get required parts of the state from other tasks.
</li>
<br /> 

<li>Many of the DART namelists have been simplified, and some items have
moved to a more specific namelist.
</li>
<br /> 

<li>Observation sequence files can include externally computed forward operator
values which can be used in the assimilation instead of calling a forward
operator inside DART.
</li>
<br /> 

<li>The DART directory structure has been reorganized to make it easier to
identify the various software tools, modules, documentation and tutorials 
supplied with the system.
</li>
<br /> 

<li>The MATLAB&reg; diagnostic routines have been updated to not require the
MEXNC toolbox.  These routines use the built-in NetCDF support that comes
with MATLAB&reg;.
</li>
<br /> 

<li>There is a new Particle Filter type.  Please contact us if you 
are interested in using it.
</li>
<br /> 

<li>DART can now take subsets of observation types and restrict them
from impacting certain quantities in the state during the assimilation.
A tool to simplify constructing the table of interactions is provided
(obs_impact_tool).
</li>
<br /> 

<li>State Structure
    <ul><li> Contains information about dimensions and size of variables in your
             state.  There is a number of accessor functions to get variable information
             such as <code>get_variable_size()</code>.
         See the  <a href="state_structure.html">state_structure.html</a>
        for more details.</li></ul>
</li>
<br /> 

<li>The POP model_mod now can interpolate Sea Surface Anomaly observations.
</li>
<br /> 


</ul>

<h2>Changed Models</h2>

<ul>

<li>WRF
<ul>
<li>Allow advanced microphysics schemes (needed interpolation for 7 new kinds)</li>
<li>Interpolation in the vertical is now done in log(p) instead of linear
pressure space.  log(p) is the default, but a compile-time variable can
restore the linear interpolation.</li>
<li>Added support in the namelist to avoid writing updated fields back into
the wrf netcdf files. The fields are still updated during the assimilation
but the updated data is not written back to the wrfinput file during the
dart_to_wrf step.</li>
<li>Fixed an obscure bug in the vertical convert routine of the wrf model_mod
that would occasionally fail to convert an obs. This would make tiny
differences in the output as the number of mpi tasks change. No quantitative
differences in the results but they were not bitwise compatible before and they
are again now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br /> 

<li>CAM
<ul>
<li>DART/CAM now runs under the CESM framework, so all options available
with the framework can be used.</li>
<li>Support for the SE core (HOMME) has been developed but is NOT part
of this release.  Please contact the <a href="mailto:dart@ucar.edu">DART
Development Group</a> if you have an interest in this configuration of CAM.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br /> 

<li>Simple Advection Model
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where the random number generator was being
used before being called with an initial seed.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>

<h2>New Diagnostics and Documentation</h2>

<p>
<strong>Better Web Pages.</strong>
We've put a lot of effort into expanding our documentation.
For example, please check out 
<a href="http://www.image.ucar.edu/DAReS/DART/DART2_Diagnostics.php#mat_obs">
the MATLAB diagnostics section</a> or the pages outlining the 
<a href="http://www.image.ucar.edu/DAReS/DART/DART2_Observations.php#obs_seq_overview">
observation sequence file contents</a>.
<br />
<ul>
<li>The MATLAB&reg; diagnostic routines have been updated to remove the dependency on third-party 
toolboxes.  These routines use the built-in netCDF support that comes
with basic MATLAB&reg; (no other toolboxes needed).
</li>
</ul>
<br />
But there's always more to add.
<strong>Please <a href="http://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/image/software/dart/suggestion-box">let us know</a> where we are lacking.</strong>
