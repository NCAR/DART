<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<h3>What's Required</h3>
<ol><li>a Fortran 90 compiler</li>
    <li>a netCDF library including the F90 interfaces</li>
    <li>the C shell</li>
    <li>(optional, to run in parallel) an MPI library</li>
</ol>
<p>
DART has been tested on many Fortran compilers and platforms.
We don't have any platform-dependent code sections and we use
only the parts of the language that are portable across all
the compilers we have access to.
We explicitly set the Fortran 'kind' for all real values and do
not rely on autopromotion or other compile-time flags to set the
default byte size for numbers.
It is possible that some model-specific interface code from
outside sources may have specific compiler flag requirements;
see the documentation for each model.
The low-order models and all common portions of the DART code 
compile cleanly.
<br />
<br />
DART uses the 
<a href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/index.jsp">netCDF</a> 
self-describing data format with a particular metadata convention to 
describe output that is used to analyze the results of assimilation 
experiments.  These files have the extension <em class=file>.nc</em> 
and can be read by a number of standard data analysis tools. 
<br />
<br />
Since most of the models being used with DART are 
written in Fortran and run on various UNIX or *nix platforms, the
development environment for DART is highly skewed to these machines.
We do most of our development on a small linux workstation and a mac laptop
running OSX 10.x, and we have an extensive test network.
(I've never built nor run DART on a Windows machine - so I don't even
know if it's possible. If you have run it (under Cygwin?) please let me
know how it went -- I'm curious.  Tim - thoar 'at' ucar 'dot ' edu)
</p>

<h3>What's nice to have</h3>

<strong>ncview</strong>: DART users have used 
<a href="http://meteora.ucsd.edu/~pierce/ncview_home_page.html">ncview</a> 
to create graphical displays of output data fields. The 2D rendering is
good for 'quick-look' type uses, but I wouldn't want to publish with it.
<br /><br />

<strong>NCO</strong>: The <a href="http://nco.sourceforge.net">NCO</a> tools 
are able to perform operations on netCDF files like concatenating, slicing, 
and dicing.<br /><br />

<strong>Matlab</strong>&reg;: A set of 
<a href="http://www.mathworks.com/">Matlab&reg;</a> scripts designed to 
produce graphical diagnostics from DART. netCDF output files are also part
of the DART project.<br /><br />

<strong>MPI</strong>: The DART system includes an MPI
option. MPI stands for 'Message Passing Interface', and is both a library and
run-time system that enables multiple copies of a single program to run in
parallel, exchange data, and combine to solve a problem more quickly.
DART does <b>NOT</b> require MPI to run; the default build
scripts do not need nor use MPI in any way. However, for larger models with
large state vectors and large numbers of observations, the data assimilation
step will run much faster in parallel, which requires MPI to be installed and
used. However, if multiple ensembles of your model fit comfortably (in time
and memory space) on a single processor, you need read no further about MPI.
<br /><br />

<h3>Types of input</h3>

<p>DART programs can require three different types of input. 
First, some of the DART programs, like those for creating synthetic
observational datasets, require interactive input from the keyboard. 
For simple cases this interactive input can be made directly 
from the keyboard. In more complicated cases a file containing 
the appropriate keyboard input can be created and this file 
can be directed to the standard input of the DART program. 
Second, many DART programs expect one or more input files in 
DART specific formats to be available. For instance, 
<em class=program>perfect_model_obs</em>, which creates a synthetic 
observation set given a particular model and a description 
of a sequence of observations, requires an input file that 
describes this observation sequence.
At present, the observation files for DART are in a custom format in either 
human-readable ascii or more compact machine-specific binary. 
Third, many DART modules (including main programs) make use of 
the Fortran90 namelist facility to obtain values of certain parameters 
at run-time. All programs look for a namelist input file 
called <em class=file>input.nml</em> in the directory in which 
the program is executed. The <em class=file>input.nml</em> 
file can contain a sequence of individual Fortran90 namelists 
which specify values of particular parameters for modules that 
compose the executable program.

<a name="Installation"></a>
<div class="top">[<a href="#">top</a>]</div><hr />
<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>
This document outlines the installation of the DART software
and the system requirements. The entire installation process is summarized in
the following steps:
</p>

<ol><li><a href="#compilers">Determine which F90 compiler is available</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="#netCDFlib">Determine the location of the 
        <em class=code>netCDF</em> library</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="#download">Download the DART software 
        into the expected source tree</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="#customizations">Modify certain DART files to reflect 
        the available F90 compiler and location of the 
	appropriate libraries</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="#building">Build the executables</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
We have tried to make the code as portable as possible, but we
do not have access to all compilers on all platforms, so there are no
guarantees. We are interested in your experience building the system,
so please email me (Tim Hoar) thoar&nbsp;'at'&nbsp;ucar&nbsp;'dot'&nbsp;edu
(trying to cut down on the spam).
</p>

<p>
After the installation, you might want to peruse the following.
</p>

<ul><li><a href="#Running">Running the Lorenz_63 Model</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="#matlab">Using the Matlab&reg; diagnostic scripts</a>.</li>
    <li>A short discussion on 
    <a href="#discussion">bias, filter divergence and covariance inflation.</a></li>
    <li>And another one on 
     <a href="#syntheticobservations">synthetic observations</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should <i>absolutely</i> run the DARTLAB
interactive tutorial (if you have Matlab available) and look at the
DARTLAB presentation slides 
Website</a> <a href="../../documentation/DART_LAB/DART_LAB.html">local file</a>
in the
<em class="file">DART_LAB</em> directory, and then take the tutorial 
in the <em class="file">DART/tutorial</em> directory.</p>

<!--==================================================================-->

<a name="compilers"></a>
<div class="top">[<a href="#">top</a>]</div><hr />
<h3>Requirements: an F90 Compiler</h3>

<p>
The DART software has been successfully built on many Linux,
OS/X, and supercomputer platforms with compilers that include
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/fortran">GNU Fortran Compiler ("gfortran")</a>
(free), 
<a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/fortran-compilers">Intel Fortran
Compiler for Linux and Mac OS/X</a>,
<a href="http://www.pgroup.com">Portland Group Fortran Compiler</a>, 
<a href="http://www.lahey.com">Lahey Fortran Compiler</a>, 
<a href="http://www.pathscale.com">Pathscale Fortran Compiler</a>, 
and the Cray native compiler.
Since recompiling the code is a necessity to experiment
with different models, there are no binaries to distribute.
</p>

<!--==================================================================-->

<a name="netCDFlib"></a>
<div class="top">[<a href="#">top</a>]</div><hr />
<h3>Requirements: the <em class=file>netCDF</em> library</h3>

<p>
DART uses the 
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/">netCDF</a> 
self-describing data format for the results of assimilation 
experiments. These files have the extension <em class=file>.nc</em> 
and can be read by a number of standard data analysis tools. 
In particular, DART also makes use of the F90 interface to the library
which is available through the <em class=file>netcdf.mod</em> and
<em class=file>typesizes.mod</em> modules. 
<em class=bold>IMPORTANT</em>: different compilers create these modules with
different "case" filenames, and sometimes they are not <strong>both</strong>
installed into the expected directory. It is required that both modules
be present. The normal place would be in the <tt>netcdf/include</tt> 
directory, as opposed to the  <tt>netcdf/lib</tt> directory.
</p>

<p>
If the netCDF library does not exist on your system, you must build
it (as well as the F90 interface modules). The library and instructions 
for building the library or installing from an RPM may be found at 
the netCDF home page: 
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/">
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/</a> 
</p>

<p>
The location of the netCDF library, <em class=file>libnetcdf.a</em>,
and the locations of both <em class=file>netcdf.mod</em> and
<em class=file>typesizes.mod</em> will be needed by the makefile
template, as described in the <a href="#compiling">compiling</a>
section.  Depending on the netCDF build options, the Fortran 90
interfaces may be built in a separate library named
<em class=file>netcdff.a</em> and you may need to add
<em class=code>-lnetcdff</em> to the library flags.
</p>

<!--==================================================================-->

<a name="download"></a>
<div class="top">[<a href="#">top</a>]</div><hr />
<h2>Downloading the distribution.</h2>

<p>
<strong>HURRAY</strong>! The DART source code is now distributed through 
an anonymous Subversion server! The <strong>big</strong> advantage is 
the ability to patch or update existing code trees at your discretion. 
Subversion (the client-side app
is '<strong>svn</strong>') allows you to compare your code tree with
one on a remote server and selectively update individual files or groups of
files. Furthermore, now everyone has access to any version of any file in
the project, which is a huge help for developers. I have a brief summary of
the svn commands I use most posted at: 
<a href="http://www.image.ucar.edu/~thoar/svn_primer.html">
http://www.image.ucar.edu/~thoar/svn_primer.html</a>
</p>
<p>
The resources to develop and support DART come from our ability to
demonstrate our growing user base. We ask that you register at our 
download site <a href="http://www.image.ucar.edu/DAReS/DART/DART_download">
http://www.image.ucar.edu/DAReS/DART/DART_download</a>
and promise that the information will only be used to notify you
of new DART releases and shown to our sponsers in an aggregated form:
"Look - we have three users from Tonawanda, NY". After filling in the form,
you will be directed to a website that has instructions on how to download
the code.
</p>
<p>
svn has adopted the strategy that "disk is cheap". In addition to downloading
the code, it downloads an additional copy of the code to store locally (in
hidden .svn directories) as well as some administration files. This allows 
svn to perform some commands even when the repository is not available.
It does double the size of the code tree for the initial download, but then
future updates download just the changes, so they usually happen very quickly.
</p>
<p>
If you follow the instructions on the download site, you should wind up with
a directory named <em class=file>DART</em>. Compiling the code in this tree 
(as is usually the case) will necessitate much more space.
</p>
<p>
The code tree is very "bushy"; there are many directories of support
routines, etc. but only a few directories involved with the
customization and installation of the DART software. If you can
compile and run ONE of the low-order models, you should be able to
compile and run ANY of the low-order models. For this reason,
we can focus on the Lorenz `63 model. Subsequently, the only
directories with files to be modified to check the installation 
are:
&nbsp;<em class=file>DART/build_templates</em>,
&nbsp;<em class=file>DART/models/lorenz_63/work</em>, and 
&nbsp;<em class=file>DART/diagnostics/matlab</em> (but only for analysis).
</p>

<!--==================================================================-->

<a name="customizations"></a>
<div class="top">[<a href="#">top</a>]</div><hr />
<h2>Customizing the build scripts -- Overview.</h2>

<p>
DART executable programs are constructed using two tools: 
<em class=program>make</em> and 
<em class=program>mkmf</em>. 
The <em class=program>make</em> utility is a very common
piece of software that requires a user-defined input file that records 
dependencies between different source files. <em class=program>make</em> 
then performs a hierarchy of actions when one or more of the
source files is modified. The <em class=program>mkmf</em> utility is 
a custom preprocessor that generates a <em class=program>make</em> input file 
(named <em class=file>Makefile</em>) and an example namelist 
<em class=file>input.nml.<em class=program><i>program</i>_default</em></em>
with the default values. The <em class=file>Makefile</em> is designed 
specifically to work with object-oriented Fortran90 (and other languages) 
for systems like DART.
</p>

<p>
<em class=program>mkmf</em> requires two separate input files. 
The first is a `template' file which specifies details of the commands 
required for a specific Fortran90 compiler and may also contain 
pointers to directories containing pre-compiled utilities required by 
the DART system. <strong>This template file will need to 
be modified to reflect your system</strong>. The second input file is a 
`path_names' file which includes a complete list of the locations 
(either relative or absolute) of all Fortran90 source files that are 
required to produce a particular DART program. 
Each 'path_names' file must contain a path for 
exactly one Fortran90 file containing a main program, 
but may contain any number of additional paths pointing to files 
containing Fortran90 modules. 
An <em class=program>mkmf</em> command is executed which 
uses the 'path_names' file and the mkmf template file to produce a 
<em class=file>Makefile</em> which is subsequently used by the
standard <em class=program>make</em> utility.
</p>

<p>
Shell scripts that execute the mkmf command for all standard 
DART executables are provided as part of the standard DART software. 
For more information on <em class=program>mkmf</em> see 
<a href="https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/~vb/mkmf.html#mkmf">
the FMS mkmf description</a>.
<br />
One of the benefits of using <em class=program>mkmf</em> is that it also 
creates an example namelist file for each program. The example namelist is 
called 
<em class=file>input.nml.<em class=program><i>program</i>_default</em></em>, 
so as not to clash with any 
exising <em class=file>input.nml</em> that may exist in that directory.
</p>

<a name="template"></a>
<h3 class=indent1>Building and Customizing the 'mkmf.template' file</h3>

<p>
A series of templates for different compilers/architectures exists 
in the <em class=file>DART/build_templates/</em> directory and have names with
extensions that identify the compiler, the architecture, or both. 
This is how you inform the build process of the specifics of your system. 
Our intent is that you copy one that is similar to your system into 
<em class=file>mkmf.template</em> and customize it.
For the discussion that follows, knowledge of the contents of one of these
templates (i.e.&nbsp;<em class=file>mkmf.template.gfortran</em>) is needed. 
Note that only the LAST lines are shown here, 
the head of the file is just a big comment (worth reading, btw).
</p>

<div class=routine>
...<br />
MPIFC = mpif90 <br />
MPILD = mpif90 <br />
FC = gfortran <br />
LD = gfortran <br />
NETCDF = /usr/local <br />
INCS = ${NETCDF}/include <br />
FFLAGS = -O2 -I$(INCS) <br />
LIBS = -L${NETCDF}/lib -lnetcdf <br />
LDFLAGS = -I$(INCS) $(LIBS) <br />
</div>

<p>
Essentially, each of the lines defines some part of the resulting 
<em class=file>Makefile</em>. Since <em class=program>make</em>
is particularly good at sorting out dependencies, the order of these 
lines really doesn't make any difference.
The <em class=code>FC = gfortran</em> line ultimately defines the 
Fortran90 compiler to use, etc.
The lines which are most likely to need site-specific changes 
start with <em class=code>FFLAGS</em> and <em class=code>NETCDF</em>, which 
indicate where to look for the netCDF F90 modules and the 
location of the netCDF library and modules.
<br /><br />
If you have MPI installed on your system <em class=code>MPIFC, MPILD</em>
dictate which compiler will be used in that instance. If you do not have
MPI, these variables are of no consequence.  
</p>

<a href="netCDF"></a>
<h4 class=indent2>NETCDF</h4>

<p class=indent1>
Modifying the <em class=code>NETCDF</em> value should be relatively
straightforward.<br />
Change the string to reflect the location of your netCDF installation 
containing <em class=file>netcdf.mod</em> and
<em class=file>typesizes.mod</em>.
The value of the <em class=code>NETCDF</em> variable will be used by 
the <em class=code>FFLAGS, LIBS,</em> and <em class=code>LDFLAGS</em> 
variables.<br />
</p>


<a href="fflags"></a>
<h4 class=indent2>FFLAGS</h4>

<p class=indent1>
Each compiler has different compile flags, so there is really no way
to exhaustively cover this other than to say the templates as we supply
them should work -- depending on the location of your netCDF.
The low-order models can be compiled without a <em class=code>-r8</em> 
switch, but the <em class=file>bgrid_solo</em> model cannot. 
</p>

<a href="libs"></a>
<h4 class=indent2>LIBS</h4>
<p class=indent1>
The Fortran 90 interfaces may be part of the default
<em class=file>netcdf.a</em> library and <em class=code>-lnetcdf</em>
is all you need.  However it is also common for the 
Fortran 90
interfaces to be built in a separate library named
<em class=file>netcdff.a</em>.  In that case you will
need <em class=code>-lnetcdf</em> and also
<em class=code>-lnetcdff</em> on the <strong>LIBS</strong> line.
This is a build-time option when the netCDF libraries
are compiled so it varies from site to site.
</p>
<br />


<a name="path_names"></a>
<h3 class=indent1>Customizing the 'path_names_*' file</h3>

<p>
Several <em class=file>path_names_*</em> files are provided in
the <em class=file>work</em> directory for each specific model, 
in this case: <em class=file>DART/models/lorenz_63/work</em>.
Since each model comes with its own set of files, the <em
class=file>path_names_*</em> files need no customization.
</p>

<!--==================================================================-->

<a name="building"></a>
<div class="top">[<a href="#">top</a>]</div><hr />
<h2>Building the Lorenz_63 DART project.</h2>

<p>DART executables are constructed in a <em class=file>work</em>
subdirectory under the directory containing code for the given model.
From the top-level DART directory change to the L63 work 
directory and list the contents:
</p>

<div class=unix>
cd DART/models/lorenz_63/work<br />
ls -1
</div>

<p>
With the result:
<pre>
filter_input.cdl
filter_input_list.txt
filter_output_list.txt
input.nml
input.workshop.nml
mkmf_create_fixed_network_seq
mkmf_create_obs_sequence
mkmf_filter

mkmf_obs_sequence_tool
mkmf_perfect_model_obs
mkmf_preprocess
obs_seq.final
obs_seq.in
obs_seq.out

obs_seq.out.xy
obs_seq.out.xyz
obs_seq.out.z
path_names_create_fixed_network_seq

path_names_perfect_model_obs
path_names_preprocess
perfect_input.cdl
quickbuild.csh
set_def.out
workshop_setup.csh</pre>

<p>
In all the <em class=file>work</em> directories there
 will be a
<em class=file>quickbuild.csh</em> script that
builds or rebuilds the executables.  The following
instructions do this work by hand to introduce you to
the individual steps, but in practice running quickbuild
will be the normal way to do the compiles.
</p>

<p>
There are seven <em class=file>mkmf_</em><em class=italic>xxxxxx</em> 
files for the programs 
</p>

<ol><li><em class=program>preprocess</em>, 
    <li><em class=program>create_obs_sequence</em>, 
    <li><em class=program>create_fixed_network_seq</em>, 
    <li><em class=program>perfect_model_obs</em>,
    <li><em class=program>filter</em>, 
    <li><em class=program>obs_sequence_tool</em>, and 
    <li><em class=program>obs_diag</em>,
</ol>

<p>
along with the 
corresponding <em class=file>path_names_</em><em class=italic>xxxxxx</em> files.
There are also files that contain initial conditions, netCDF output, and 
several observation sequence files, all of which will be discussed later.
You can examine the contents of one of the 
<em class=file>path_names_</em><em class=italic>xxxxxx</em> files, 
for instance <em class=file>path_names_filter</em>, to see a list of 
the relative paths of all files that contain Fortran90 modules 
required for the program <em class=program>filter</em> for 
the L63 model. All of these paths are relative to your 
<em class=file>DART</em> directory.
The first path is the main program 
(<em class=file>filter.f90</em>) and is followed by all 
the Fortran90 modules used by this program (after preprocessing).
</p>

<p>
The <em class=program>mkmf_</em><em class=italic>xxxxxx</em> scripts 
are cryptic but should not need to be modified -- as long as you do not
restructure the code tree (by moving directories, for example).

The function of the <em class=program>mkmf_</em><em class=italic>xxxxxx</em> 
script is to generate a <em class=file>Makefile</em> and an 
<em class=file>input.nml.<em class=program><i>program</i>_default</em></em>
file.  It does not do the compile; <em class=program>make</em>
does that:
</p>

<div class=unix>
csh mkmf_preprocess<br />
make
</div>

<p>
The first command generates an appropriate <em class=file>Makefile</em> and
the <em class=file>input.nml.preprocess_default</em> file. 
The second command results in the compilation of a series of 
Fortran90 modules which ultimately produces an executable file: 
<em class=program>preprocess</em>.
Should you need to make any changes to the 
<em class=file>DART/build_templates/mkmf.template</em>, 
you will need to regenerate the <em class=file>Makefile</em>.  
<br /><br />
The <em class=program>preprocess</em> program actually builds source code to
be used by all the remaining modules. It is <strong>imperative</strong> to
actually <strong>run</strong> <em class=program>preprocess</em> before building
the remaining executables. This is how the same code can assimilate state 
vector 'observations' for the Lorenz_63 model and real radar reflectivities for WRF 
without needing to specify a set of radar operators for the Lorenz_63 model!
<br /><br />
<em class=program>preprocess</em> reads the <em class=code>&amp;preprocess_nml</em>
namelist to determine what observations and operators to incorporate. 
For this exercise, we will use the values in <em class=file>input.nml</em>.
<em class=program>preprocess</em> is designed to abort if
the files it is supposed to build already exist. For this reason, it is necessary
to remove a couple files (if they exist) before you run the preprocessor.
(The <em class=program>quickbuild.csh</em> script will do this for you
automatically.)
</p>

<div class=unix>
<pre>
\rm -f ../../../observations/forward_operators/obs_def_mod.f90
\rm -f ../../../assimilation_code/modules/observations/obs_kind_mod.f90
./preprocess
ls -l  ../../../observations/forward_operators/obs_def_mod.f90
ls -l  ../../../assimilation_code/modules/observations/obs_kind_mod.f90
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This created <em class=file>DART/observations/forward_operators/obs_def_mod.f90</em> from
<em class=file>DART/assimilation_code/modules/observations/DEFAULT_obs_kind_mod.F90</em> and several other
modules. <em class=file>DART/assimilation_code/modules/observations/obs_kind_mod.f90</em> was created similarly.
Now we can build the rest of the project.
<br /><br />
A series of object files for each module compiled will also be 
left in the work directory, as some of these are undoubtedly needed by the build
of the other DART components.
You can proceed to create the other programs needed to work with 
L63 in DART as follows:
</p>

<div class=unix>
csh mkmf_create_obs_sequence<br />
make<br />
csh mkmf_create_fixed_network_seq<br />
make<br />
csh mkmf_perfect_model_obs<br />
make<br />
csh mkmf_filter<br />
make<br />
csh mkmf_obs_diag<br />
make
</div><br />

<p>
The result (hopefully) is that six executables now 
reside in your work directory. The most common problem is that the netCDF libraries
and include files (particularly <em class=file>typesizes.mod</em>) are not found. 
Edit the <em class=file>DART/build_templates/mkmf.template</em>,
recreate the <em class=file>Makefile</em>, and try again.

<h2>Running Lorenz_63.</h2>

<p>
This initial sequence of exercises includes detailed instructions 
on how to work with the DART code and allows investigation of the 
basic features of one of the most famous dynamical systems, the 
3-variable Lorenz-63 model.
The remarkable complexity of this simple model will also be used as 
a case study to introduce a number of features of a simple ensemble 
filter data assimilation system. 
To perform a synthetic observation assimilation experiment 
for the L63 model, the following steps must be performed 
(an overview of the process is given first, 
followed by detailed procedures for each step): 
</p>

<h2 class=indent1>Experiment Overview</h2>
<ol>
   <li><a href="#integrate">Integrate the L63 model for a long time</a><br />
   starting from arbitrary initial conditions to generate a model state 
   that lies on the attractor. The ergodic nature of the L63 system 
   means a 'lengthy' integration always converges to some point on 
   the computer's finite precision representation of the model's 
   attractor.<br /><br /></li>

   <li><a href="#ensemblate">Generate a set of ensemble initial conditions</a><br />
   from which to start an assimilation. Since L63 is ergodic, the 
   ensemble members can be designed to look like random samples from 
   the model's 'climatological distribution'.  To generate an ensemble 
   member, very small perturbations can be introduced to the state on 
   the attractor generated by step 1. This perturbed state can then be 
   integrated for a very long time until all memory of its initial 
   condition can be viewed as forgotten. Any number of ensemble 
   initial conditions can be generated by repeating this procedure.<br /><br /></li>

   <li><a href="#simulate">Simulate a particular observing system</a><br />
   by first creating an 'observation set definition' and then creating
   an 'observation sequence'. The 'observation set definition' describes the 
   instrumental characteristics of the observations and the 'observation sequence'
   defines the temporal sequence of the observations.<br /><br /></li>

   <li><a href="#generate">Populate the 'observation sequence' with 'perfect' observations</a><br />
   by integrating the model and using the information in the 
   'observation sequence' file to create simulated observations.
   This entails operating on the model state at the 
   time of the observation with an appropriate forward operator 
   (a function that operates on the model state vector to produce 
   the expected value of the particular observation) and then adding 
   a random sample from the observation error distribution specified 
   in the observation set definition.  At the same time, diagnostic 
   output about the 'true' state trajectory can be created.<br /><br /></li>

   <li><a href="#assimilate">Assimilate the synthetic observations</a><br />
   by running the filter; diagnostic output is generated.</li>
</ol>

<a name="integrate"></a>
<h3 class=indent1>1. Integrate the L63 model for a 'long' time.</h3>
<em class=program>perfect_model_obs</em> integrates the model
for all the times specified in the 'observation sequence definition' file.
To this end, begin by creating an 'observation sequence definition' 
file that spans a long time. Creating an 'observation sequence definition' 
file is a two-step procedure involving 
<em class=program>create_obs_sequence</em> followed by 
<em class=program>create_fixed_network_seq</em>. After they are both run, it
is necessary to integrate the model with <em class=program>perfect_model_obs</em>.

<h4 class=indent1>1.1 Create an observation set definition.</h4>
<p>
<em class=program>create_obs_sequence</em> creates an observation 
set definition, the time-independent part of an observation sequence. 
An observation set definition file only contains the 
<em class=code>location, type,</em> 
and <em class=code>observational error characteristics</em> 
(normally just the diagonal observational error variance) 
for a related set of observations. There are no actual observations,
nor are there any times associated with the definition.
For spin-up, we are only interested in integrating the L63 model, 
not in generating any particular synthetic observations. 
Begin by creating a minimal observation set definition.<br />
<br /> 
In general, for the low-order models, only a single observation set need
be defined. Next, the number of individual scalar observations 
(like a single surface pressure observation) in the set is needed. 
To spin-up an initial condition for the L63 model, only a  
single observation is needed. 
Next, the error variance for this observation must be entered. 
Since we do not need (nor want) this observation to have any impact 
on an assimilation (it will only be used for spinning up the model 
and the ensemble), enter a very large value for the error variance. 
An observation with a very large error variance has essentially no 
impact on deterministic filter assimilations like the default variety 
implemented in DART.  Finally, the location and type of the 
observation need to be defined.  For all types of models, 
the most elementary form of synthetic observations are called 
'identity' observations. These observations are generated simply 
by adding a random sample from a specified observational error 
distribution directly to the value of one of the state variables. 
This defines the observation as being an identity observation of the 
first state variable in the L63 model.
The program will respond by terminating after generating a file 
(generally named <em class=file>set_def.out</em>) 
that defines the single identity observation of the first 
state variable of the L63 model. The following is a screenshot 
(much of the verbose logging has been left off for clarity),
the user input looks <em class=input>like this</em>.

<h4 class=indent1>1.2 Create an observation sequence definition.</h4>
<p>
<em class=program>create_fixed_network_seq</em> creates an 'observation 
sequence definition' by extending the 'observation set definition'
with the temporal attributes of the observations.<br />
<br />
The first input is the name of the file created in the previous step, 
i.e. the name of the observation set definition that you've just created. 
It is possible to create sequences in which the observation sets 
are observed at regular intervals or irregularly in time. 
Here, all we need is a sequence that takes observations over a 
long period of time - indicated by entering a 1.
Although the L63 system normally is defined as having a non-dimensional 
time step, the DART system arbitrarily defines the model 
timestep as being 3600 seconds. 
If we declare that we have one observation per day for 1000 days, 
we create an observation sequence definition 
spanning 24000 'model' timesteps; sufficient to spin-up the model 
onto the attractor. Finally, enter a name for the 
'observation sequence definition' file. Note again: there are no observation
values present in this file. Just an observation type, location, time and the
error characteristics. We are going to populate the observation sequence
with the <em class=program>perfect_model_obs</em> program.

<p>
   <em class=program>perfect_model_obs</em> can now advance the
   arbitrary initial state for 24,000 timesteps to move it onto the
   attractor.<br />
   <em class=program>perfect_model_obs</em> uses the Fortran90 namelist 
   input mechanism instead of (admittedly gory, but temporary) interactive input.  
   All of the DART software expects the namelists to found in a file called 
   <em class=file>input.nml</em>. When you built the executable, 
   an example namelist was created 
   <em class=file>input.nml.perfect_model_obs_default</em>
   that contains all of the namelist input for the executable. 
   If you followed the example, each namelist was saved 
   to a unique name. We must now rename and edit the namelist file for 
   <em class=program>perfect_model_obs</em>. 
   Copy <em class=file>input.nml.perfect_model_obs_default</em>

<h3 class=indent1>2. Generate a set of ensemble initial conditions.</h3>

<p class=indent1>
   The set of initial conditions for a 'perfect model' experiment is 
   created in several steps.   1) Starting from the spun-up state of the model 
   (available in <em class=file>perfect_restart</em>),
   run <em class=program>perfect_model_obs</em> to generate
   the 'true state' of the experiment and a corresponding set of 
   observations. 2) Feed the same initial spun-up state 
   and resulting observations into <em class=program>filter</em>. 
   <br /><br />
   The first step is achieved by changing a perfect_model_obs namelist parameter, 
   copying <em class=file>perfect_restart</em> to 
   <em class=file>perfect_ics</em>, and 
   rerunning <em class=program>perfect_model_obs</em>.
   This execution of <em class=program>perfect_model_obs</em> 
   will advance the model state from 
   the end of the first 24,000 steps to the end of an additional 24,000 
   steps and place the final state in <em class=file>perfect_restart</em>.
   The rest of the namelists in <em class=file>input.nml</em> should remain
   unchanged.

   A <em class=file>True_State.nc</em> 
   file is also created. It contains the 'true' state of the integration.
</p>

<h4 class=indent1>Generating the ensemble</h4>

   <p class=indent1>
   This step (#2 from above) is done with the program <em class=program>filter</em>, 
   which also uses the Fortran90 namelist mechanism for input. It is now necessary 
   to copy the <em class=file>input.nml.filter_default</em> namelist to 
   <em class=file>input.nml</em>.</p>

   <div class=indent1>
   cp input.nml.filter_default input.nml<br />
   </div>

   <p class=indent1>
   You may also build one master namelist containting all the required 
   namelists. Having unused namelists in the <em class=file>input.nml</em> 
   does not hurt anything, and it has been so useful to be reminded of what 
   is possible that we made it an error to NOT have a required namelist. 
   Take a peek at any of the other models for examples of a "fully qualified"
   <em class=file>input.nml</em>.
   <br />
   <br />
   <em>HINT:</em> if you used <em class="program">svn</em> to get the project, 
   try 'svn revert input.nml' to restore the namelist that was distributed
   with the project - which DOES have all the namelist blocks. Just be sure 
   the values match the examples here.

<p class=indent1>
   The filter is told to generate its own ensemble initial conditions 
   since <em class=code>start_from_restart</em> is '.false.'. 
   However, it is important to note that the filter still makes use of 
   <em class=file>perfect_ics</em> which is set to be the 
   <em class=code>restart_in_file_name</em>. 
   This is the model state generated from the first 24,000 step model 
   integration by <em class=program>perfect_model_obs</em>.
   <em class=program>Filter</em> generates its ensemble initial conditions 
   by randomly perturbing the state variables of this state.
</p> 

<p class=indent1>
<em class=code>num_output_state_members</em> are '.true.' so 
the state vector is output at every time for which there are 
observations (once a day here).
<em class=file>Posterior_Diag.nc</em> and <em class=file>Prior_Diag.nc</em> 
then contain values for 20 ensemble members once a day. 
Once the namelist is set, execute <em class=program>filter</em> to 
integrate the ensemble forward for 24,000 steps with the final ensemble 
state written to the <em class=file>filter_restart</em>.
Copy the <em class=program>perfect_model_obs</em> restart file
<em class=file>perfect_restart</em> (the `true state') to 
<em class=file>perfect_ics</em>, and the
<em class=program>filter</em> restart file 
<em class=file>filter_restart</em> to 
<em class=file>filter_ics</em> so that future assimilation experiments 
can be initialized from these spun-up states.

<p class=indent1>
The spin-up of the ensemble can be viewed by examining the 
output in the netCDF files <em class=file>True_State.nc</em> 
generated by <em class=program>perfect_model_obs</em> and 
<em class=file>Posterior_Diag.nc</em> and <em class=file>Prior_Diag.nc</em> 
generated by <em class=program>filter</em>.

<h3 class=indent1>3. Simulate a particular observing system.</h3>

<p class=indent1>Begin by using <em class=program>create_obs_sequence</em> to 
generate an observation set in which each of the 3 state variables 
of L63 is observed with an observational error variance of 1.0 
for each observation.  To do this, use the following input 
sequence (the text including and after # is a comment and does 
not need to be entered):</p>

<table class=indent1 bgcolor="#CCCCCC" summary="example input for create_obs_sequence">
<tr><td><em class=input>4</em></td>
    <td># upper bound on num of observations in sequence</td></tr>
<tr><td><em class=input>0</em></td>
    <td># number of copies of data (0 for just a definition)</td></tr>
<tr><td><em class=input>0</em></td>
    <td># number of quality control values per field (0 or greater)</td></tr>
<tr><td><em class=input>0</em></td>
    <td># -1 to exit/end observation definitions</td></tr>
<!-- observe state variable 1 -->
<tr><td><em class=input>-1</em></td>
    <td># observe state variable 1</td></tr>
<tr><td><em class=input>0 &nbsp; 0</em></td>
    <td># time -- days, seconds </td></tr>
<tr><td><em class=input>1.0</em></td>
    <td># observational variance</td></tr>
<tr><td><em class=input>0</em></td>
    <td># -1 to exit/end observation definitions</td></tr>
<!-- observe state variable 2 -->
<tr><td><em class=input>-2</em></td>
    <td># observe state variable 2</td></tr>
<tr><td><em class=input>0 &nbsp; 0</em></td>
    <td># time -- days, seconds </td></tr>

    <td># observational variance</td></tr>
<tr><td><em class=input>0</em></td>
    <td># -1 to exit/end observation definitions</td></tr>

    <td># -1 to exit/end observation definitions</td></tr>
<tr><td><em class=input>set_def.out</em></td>
    <td># Output file name</td></tr>
</table>

<p class=indent1>
Now, generate an observation sequence definition by running 
<em class=program>create_fixed_network_seq</em> with the 
following input sequence:</p>

<table class=indent1 bgcolor="#CCCCCC" summary="example input for create_fixed_network_seq" >

    <td># Input observation set definition file</td></tr>

<tr><td><em class=input>1000</em></td>
    <td># 1000 observation times </td></tr>
<tr><td><em class=input>0, 43200</em></td>
    <td># First observation after 12 hours (0 days, 12 * 3600 seconds)</td></tr>
<tr><td><em class=input>0, 43200</em></td>
    <td># Observations every 12 hours </td></tr>
<tr><td><em class=input>obs_seq.in</em></td>
    <td># Output file for observation sequence definition</td></tr>

<h3 class=indent1>4. Generate a particular observing system and true state.</h3>

<p class=indent1>
   An observation sequence file is now generated by running 
   <em class=program>perfect_model_obs</em> with the namelist 
   values (unchanged from step 2):

   adv_ens_command       = "./advance_ens.csh"  /
</pre>
</div>

<p class=indent1>
   This integrates the model starting from the state in 
   <em class=file>perfect_ics</em> for 1000 12-hour intervals 
   outputting synthetic observations of the three state variables 
   every 12 hours and producing a netCDF diagnostic file,

<h2>Matlab&reg; Diagnostics</h2>
<p>The output files are netCDF files and may be examined with many
different software packages. We use Matlab&reg;, and provide our
diagnostic scripts in the hopes that they are useful.
</p>
<p>
The diagnostic scripts and underlying functions reside in two places: 
<em class=file>DART/diagnostics/matlab</em> and
<em class=file>DART/matlab</em>. 
They are reliant on the public-domain MEXNC/SNCTOOLS netCDF interface from
<a href="http://mexcdf.sourceforge.net">http://mexcdf.sourceforge.net</a>.
If you do not have them installed on your system and want to use Matlab to peruse netCDF,
you must follow their installation instructions. The 'interested reader' may want to
look at the <em class=code>DART/matlab/startup.m</em> file I use on my system.
If you put it in your <em class=unix>$HOME/matlab</em> directory 
it is invoked every time you start up Matlab.
</p>

<p>Once you can access the <em class=program>nc_varget</em> function from within Matlab
you can use our diagnostic scripts. It is necessary to prepend the location of
the <em class=file>DART/matlab</em> scripts to the <em class=code>matlabpath</em>. 
Keep in mind the location of the netcdf
operators on your system WILL be different from ours ... and that's OK.

<h2>Bias, filter divergence and covariance inflation (with the L63 model)</h2>

One of the common problems with ensemble filters is filter divergence, 
which can also be an issue with a variety of other flavors of filters 
including the classical Kalman filter. In filter divergence, 
the prior estimate of the model state becomes too confident, 
either by chance or because of errors in the forecast model, 
the observational error characteristics, or approximations 
in the filter itself.
If the filter is inappropriately confident that its prior estimate 
is correct, it will then tend to give less weight to observations 
than they should be given. 
The result can be enhanced overconfidence in the model's 
state estimate.
In severe cases, this can spiral out of control and the ensemble 
can wander entirely away from the truth, confident that it is 
correct in its estimate.
In less severe cases, the ensemble estimates may not diverge 
entirely from the truth but may still be too confident in their 
estimate.
The result is that the truth ends up being farther away from 
the filter estimates than the spread of the filter ensemble 
would estimate.
This type of behavior is commonly detected using rank histograms 
(also known as Talagrand diagrams).
You can see the rank histograms for the L63 initial assimilation 
by using the matlab script <em class=program>plot_bins</em>.  

<p>
A simple, but surprisingly effective way of dealing with filter 
divergence is known as covariance inflation.
In this method, the prior ensemble estimate of the state is 
expanded around its mean by a constant factor, effectively 
increasing the prior estimate of uncertainty while leaving the 
prior mean estimate unchanged.
The program <em class=program>filter</em> has a group of namelist 
parameters that controls the application of covariance inflation. 
For a simple set of inflation values, you will set
<em class=code>inf_flavor</em>, and
<em class=code>inf_initial</em>.
These values come in pairs; the first value controls inflation
of the prior ensemble values, while the second controls
inflation of the posterior values.
Up to this point <em class=code>inf_flavor</em> has been set 
to 0 indicating that the prior ensemble is left unchanged.
Setting the first value of <em class=code>inf_flavor</em> 
to 3 enables one variety of inflation.
Set <em class=code>inf_initial</em> to different values
(try 1.05 and 1.10 and other values).
In each case, use the diagnostic matlab tools to examine the 
resulting changes to the error, the ensemble spread 
(via rank histogram bins, too), etc.
What kind of relation between spread and error is seen in 
this model?

<p>
There are many more options for inflation, including spatially
and temporarily varying values, with and without damping.  See 
the discussion of all inflation-related namelist items

<h2>Synthetic Observations</h2>
<p>Synthetic observations are generated from a `perfect' model integration, 
which is often referred to as the `truth' or a `nature run'. 
A model is integrated forward from some set of initial conditions and 
observations are generated as <em class=equation>y = H(x) + e</em>
where <em class=equation>H</em> is an operator on the model state 
vector, <em class=equation>x</em>, that gives the expected value of a 
set of observations, <em class=equation>y</em>, 
and <em class=equation>e</em> is a random variable with a distribution 
describing the error characteristics of the observing instrument(s) 
being simulated. 
Using synthetic observations in this way allows students to learn about 
assimilation algorithms while being isolated from the 
additional (extreme) complexity associated with model error and unknown 
observational error characteristics. 
In other words, for the real-world assimilation problem, the model has 
(often substantial) differences from what happens in the real system 
and the observational error distribution may be very complicated and 
is certainly not well known. 
Be careful to keep these issues in mind while exploring 
the capabilities of the ensemble filters with synthetic observations.
