# Script to compare the output files from running test_dart.csh on two
# code bases (in preparation to merge, for example). The files under version
# control are not considered, and the executables themselves are not considered.
#
# If the file is a netCDF file, the compare_states utility is run and will only
# create output if there is a difference in one of the numeric fields.
# If the file is a text file, 'xxdiff' is used to compare the files.
# Otherwise, the file must be a binary file and 'cmp' is used.
#
# The list of files to check is created from the BRANCH1 directory.
# Nuisance files (dart_log.*, input*default) and compiled executables
# are removed from each directory to facilitate meaningful comparison.

# FIXME ... this script should not be run in either the BRANCH1 or the BRANCH2
# because the compare_states executable will be removed by the findexec step.
