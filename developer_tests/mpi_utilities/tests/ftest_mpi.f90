program ftest_mpi

! simple MPI fortran program.  use to test running interactively
! with MPI parallel communication libraries.  warning -- this program
! may compile without obvious errors, but at runtime, unless MPI_Init()
! returns 0 as the error code, there is a good chance the compile and
! link phase did not succeed.

! Most fortran MPI implementations provide either a fortran 90 module
! which defines the interfaces to the MPI library routines, or an include
! file which defines constants.  Try to use the module if it is available.

! the NAG compiler needs these special definitions enabled
! the 'fixsystem' script in the assimilation_code/modules/utilities dir
