Before using the cam-fv interface, we recommend
you become familiar with DART by working through 
the core parts of the tutorial.

The scripts which set up CAM and CAM-DART assimilations are in
the shell_scripts directory. 
There is a subdirectory for the releases of CESM which work with DART.

Working through setup_hybrid will guide you 
through setting up the multi-instance CAM-FV environment 
which DART requires.
That script includes instructions for activating the 
assimilation using DART_config.template.
Do check the output of the forecasts and assimilations 
carefully, to catch errors earlier in the development process.
We highly recommend using observation space diagnostics
to evaluate your results.

Once you are comfortable with those procedures,
you may want to explore the setup_advanced script,
which has advanced features.

CESM's automated testing includes the features that DART requires.
You should be able to use CESM versions newer than 2.0 with DART.
We recommend that you set up a new shell_scripts/cesm#_#
directory, modeled on the cesm2_1 directory, to minimize
problems running with multiple CESM versions.

If you discover that CESM is not playing well with DART,
and you have tried the simple fixes (increasing nodes/member,
decreasing ensemble size, removing your SourceMods, etc)
please contact us at dart@ucar.edu.
