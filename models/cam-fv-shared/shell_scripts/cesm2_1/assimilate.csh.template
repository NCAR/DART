# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose: assimilate with a CAM ensemble and perform advanced archiving
#          and compression in support of multiple assimilation cycles in a
#          single CESM job.
#
# The (resulting) assimilate.csh script is called by CESM with two arguments:
# 1) the CASEROOT, and
# 2) the assimilation cycle number in this CESM job
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This template is lightly modified by the setup scripts to be appropriate
# for specific hardware and other configurations. The modified result is
# then given execute permission and is appropriate to use for an assimilation.
# All of this is automatically performed by the DART-supplied setup scripts.
#
# Tag DART's state output with names using CESM's convention:
#    ${case}.${scomp}[_$inst].${filetype}[.$dart_file].${date}.nc
#    These should all be named with $scomp = "cam" to distinguish
#    them from the same output from other components in multi-component assims.
#
# This script also has logic in it to manage disk space in a way that allows
# for more assimilation cycles to be performed before archiving without losing
# critical restart capability. The same logic is also useful for assimilations
# that may require multiple timesteps to be available.
#
# As a specific example, consider the case when 3 assimilation cycles have been
# performed: 6Z, 12Z, 18Z.
# If we want to keep a restart set and a backup
# restart set, we only need the 18Z and 12Z, so the 6Z set can be removed.
# Let's also say that its the last cycle of job - which automatically kicks off
# the short-term archiver. If we did 'nothing', the 12Z and 18Z get archived
# and the 18Z gets restaged

# If the files in input_state_file_list are CESM initial files (all vars and

#    > ... for all members
# Filter will replace the state variables in preassim_member* with updated versions,
# but leave the other variables and all metadata unchanged.
