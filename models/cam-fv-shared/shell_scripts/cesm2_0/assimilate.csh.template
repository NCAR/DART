#          be output.

#=========================================================================

# In the default mode of CAM assimilations, filter gets the model state(s) 
# from CAM initial files.  This section puts the names of those files into a text file.
# The name of the text file is provided to filter in filter_nml:input_state_file_list.

# NOTE: 
# If the files in input_state_file_list are CESM initial files (all vars and 
# all meta data), then they will end up with a different structure than 
# the non-'output', stage output written by filter ('preassim', 'postassim', etc.).  
# This can be prevented (at the cost of more disk space) by copying 
# the CESM format initial files into the names filter will use for preassim, etc.:
#    > cp $case.cam_0001.i.$date.nc  preassim_member_0001.nc.  
#    > ... for all members
# Filter will replace the state variables in preassim_member* with updated versions, 
# but leave the other variables and all metadata unchanged.

# If filter will create an ensemble from a single state,
#    filter_nml: perturb_from_single_instance = .true.
# it's fine (and convenient) to put the whole list of files in input_state_file_list.  
# Filter will just use the first as the base to perturb.
