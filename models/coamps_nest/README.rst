Overview
========

An updated version of the COAMPS model interfaces and scripts.

This interface was contributed by Alex Reinecke of the Naval Research
Lab-Monterey.

The primary differences from the original COAMPS model code are:

- the ability to assimilate nested domains
- assimilates real observations
- a simplified way to specify the state vector
- I/O COAMPS data files
- extensive script updates to accommodate additional HPC environments
