# DART $Id$

# Information about the DART directory structure, file locations, and
# the like.  This is referenced in the setup of COAMPS DART scripts
# and provides a central location for paths that will be used for
# multiple tasks (i.e. in creation of the advance_*.csh scripts)
#
# This is included in shell scripts with the bash "source" function so
# we can go and use things like comments, etc. if we need to add
# anything else.  This also means we need to follow the bash style of
# variable assignment.

### Location shortcuts

### Data locations
#
#
# Location of COAMPS data for this run
# If multiple directories are needed (e.g. for a pre-existing ensemble),
# use syntax for this definition that will be passed to a printf function
# along with the ensemble member number.  
# Example:
# If the data is in coamps_ens_001, coamps_ens_002, coamps_ens_003, etc.
# COAMPS_DATA=coamps_ens_%03d
# so when printf is called with the member number, it will generate a
# valid path.

# Location of restart file to use as an initial condition
# If dealing with restart files created by parallel processes (i.e.
# npr0nam = 0 in the COAMPS namelist), use wildcards so a copy/move will
# get all of the files.
# Example:
#  restarta1p???20060125000030000
# will encompass restarta1p00020060125..., restarta1p00120060125..., etc.
