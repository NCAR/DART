These are the instructions to run pe2lyr model.

I) To build the model and simply test that it runs:

1) Modify "DART/mkmf/mkmf.template" to match your system and compiler
   (copy the closest template in that directory to this name and customize it).
*  take -r8 out for the portland fortran compiler

2) Go to DART/models/pe2lyr/work and run 'csh ./workshop_setup.csh'
   This creates make files and runs make to create an assortment of
   executables.  It also runs 'perfect_model_obs' and 'filter' before exiting.
   These use an existing obs_seq.in file which contains 10 observations and
   runs quickly for testing.


II) To run an experiment with the existing grid size and with a 100 day spinup:

TODO: add instructions here about using existing files checked into svn


III) To spin up a different grid size, or to spin up the state for other than
     the existing 100 day files:

0) To change grid size, edit DART/models/pe2lyr/model_mod.f90 and include one of
   the 3 existing 'resoltXX.h' files.  cd into 'work' and rebuild the 
   executables by running 'csh ./workshop_setup.csh'

1) Generate a single identity observation by running ./create_obs_sequence
   and use the following inputs when prompted:

     upper bound on # obs:  1
     # copies of data:  0
     # quality control:  0
     -1 to quit:  1
     var type:   -30
     time:   0 0
     error var:   1000000
     input filename:  set_def.one_identity_obs

2) Generate a 100 day sequence to use in spinning up the model by running
    ./create_fixed_network_seq and using the following inputs when prompted:

     input filename:  set_def.one_identity_obs
     regular or irreg spacing:  1
     # times in seq:   100
     initial time:  1 0
     period time:   1 0
     output file:   obs_seq.100days

3) Edit input.nml. In the &perfect_model_obs_nml section change or verify
   these values are set:
 
      start_from_restart = .false.
      output_restart = .true.
      restart_in_file_name = 'perfect_ics'
      restart_out_file_name = 'perfect_restart'
      obs_seq_in_file_name = 'obs_seq.100days'
      obs_seq_out_file_name = 'obs_seq.100days.out'
    
4) Run ./perfect_model_obs to spin up the model.  This takes a little time.
     The output restart file 'perfect_restart' contains the updated state after
     the spin up, and 'True_State.nc' contains the data in U,V,Z format.
   
5) Generate a 50 day sequence to use as the basis for 20 ensemble members by
    rerunning ./create_fixed_network_seq and using the following inputs:
     
     input filename:  set_def.one_identity_obs
     regular or irreg spacing:  1
     # times in seq:   50
     initial time:  1 0
     period time:   1 0
     output file:   obs_seq.50days
     
6) Copy the updated state after spinup to the initial condition file:

     cp perfect_restart perfect_ics

7) Edit input.nml. In the &perfect_model_obs_nml section change or verify
   these values are set:
 
      start_from_restart = .true.
      output_restart = .true.
      restart_in_file_name = 'perfect_ics'
      restart_out_file_name = 'perfect_restart'
      obs_seq_in_file_name = 'obs_seq.50days'
      obs_seq_out_file_name = 'obs_seq.50days.out'
    
8) Run ./perfect_model_obs to generate values for the 50 days of observations
    and the 'True_State.nc' file.

9) Edit input.nml. In the &filter_nml section change or verify
   these values are set:
 
      ens_size = 80
      start_from_restart = .false.
      output_restart = .true.
      restart_in_file_name = 'perfect_ics'
      restart_out_file_name = 'filter_restart'
      obs_seq_in_file_name = 'obs_seq.50days.out'
      obs_seq_out_file_name = 'obs_seq.final'
    
      inf_flavor = 0, 0

8) Run ./filter to generate 80 ensembles, perturbed from the single 
   perfect_restart file.   This step also takes a while.

9) Examine the ensemble spread by using 'ncview Prior_Diag.nc' and examining 
    copy 2 of the u, v, and z fields.

10) If the ensemble spread is not enough, rerun ./perfect_model_obs 
    and ./filter starting with the final states from the previous step:

    cp perfect_restart perfect_ics
    ./perfect_model_obs
    cp filter_restart filter_ics
    edit input.nml:
       set restart_in_file_name = 'filter_ics'
       set start_from_restart = .true.
    ./filter
   

--- updated only to here ----

the copy below in old step 9 should still happen, and then the ic files
can be used as the basis of further experiments.

* ens_size should be consistant with future run for real obs

9) cp perfect_restart perfect_ics
   cp filter_restart filter_ics

*  perfect_ics, filter_ics is very important for future test.
 test always can start from here

10) simulate obs_seq.in_151 is a file containing 362 obs for each day 
    (151 days total). ** THIS FILE IS NOT CONVERTED TO THE CURRENT OBS FORMAT
    those 362 obs locations come from Jeff Whitaker's expts,
    so test result can be compared with what we already have. 

11) change obs_seq_in_file_name = "obs_seq.in_151"
    obs_seq_out_file_name = "obs_seq.out_151"  for &perfect_model_obs_nml
    change obs_sequence_file_name = "obs_seq.out_151" for &filter_nml
    in input.nml

12) repeat step 7 and 8 with cutoff=0.25, inf_flavor=3, 0, inf_initial=1.01,
    start_from_restart=true.
