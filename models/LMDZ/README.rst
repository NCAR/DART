LMDZ
====

Overview
--------

The `Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique Zoom (LMDZ)
<https://lmdz.lmd.jussieu.fr/le-projet-lmdz-en-bref-en>`_ model is a global
atmospheric model developed by the Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL) in
France. It serves as the atmospheric component of the IPSL Integrated Climate
Model.

The DART interface to LMDZ was primarily developed by **Tarkeshwar Singh** while he
was at the Indian Institute of Technology at Delhi. He later moved to the
Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center in Bergen, Norway. A detailed
description of the LMDZ DART implementation is published in Singh et al.
(2015). [1]_

Please email `Tarkeshwar <tarkphysics87@gmail.com>`_ for documentation beyond
what is contained within the repository.

**Assimilation with LMDZ is supported in the Lanai release of DART.
If you are interested in using LMDZ in the Manhattan version of DART, we
encourage you to contact us. We would like to participate!**
