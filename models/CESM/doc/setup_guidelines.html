<A NAME="OVERVIEW"></A>
<H2>CESM+DART Setup Overview</H2>

<P>
If you found your way to this file without reading more basic DART
help files, please read those first.
$DART/README is a good place to find pointers to those files.
This document gives specific help in setting up a
CESM+DART assimilation for the first time.
Unless you just came from there, also see the
../{your_model(s)}/model_mod.html documentation
about the code-level interfaces and namelist values.
</P>

<H4>
CESM context
</H4>

<P>
Most other models are either called by DART (low order models),
or are run by DART via a shell script command (e.g. WRF).
In contrast, CESM runs its forecast, and then calls DART
to do the assimilation.
The result is that assimilation set-up scripts for CESM components
focus on modifying the set-up and build of CESM to accommodate
DART's needs, such as multi-instance forecasts, stopping at
the assimilation times to run filter, and restarting with the
updated model state.
The amount of modification of CESM depends on which version
of CESM is being used.  Later versions require fewer changes
because CESM has accommodated more of DART's needs with each
CESM release.
This release of DART focuses on selected CESM versions from 1_2_1 onward,
through CESM2 (June, 2017) and versions to be added later.
Using this DART with other CESM versions will quite possibly fail.
</P>

<P>
Since the ability to use DART has not been completely integrated 
into CESM testing, it is necessary to use some CESM fortran 
subroutines which have been modified for use with DART.
These must be provided to CESM through the SourceMods mechanism.
SourceMods for selected versions of CESM are available from
the DART website.  They can often be used as a template for
making a SourceMods for a different CESM version.
If you have other CESM modifications, they must be merged with
the DART modifications.

<H4>
CESM2
</H4>

CESM2 (expected release May, 2017) has several helpful improvements,
from DART's perspective.
</P>
<UL>
   <LI> Reduced number of subroutines in DART's SourceMods. </LI>
   <LI> "Multi-instance" capability enables the ensemble forecasts DART needs.
   <LI> Cycling capability, enabling multiple assimilation cycles
        in a single job, which reduces the frequency of waiting in the queue. </LI>
   <LI> Removal of the short term archiver from the run script
        so that the MPI run doesn't need to idle while the single task archiver runs.
        This significantly reduces the core hours required. </LI>
   <LI> CESM's translation of the short term archiver to python,
        and control of it to an xml file ($caseroot/env_archive.xml),
        so that DART modifications to the short term archiver are
        more straight-forward.  </LI>
   <LI> The creation of a new component class, 
        "External Statistical Processing" ("esp"),
        of which DART is the first instance, integrates DART more fully
        into the CESM development, testing, and running environment. 
        This is the same as the atm class, which has CAM as an instance.
        This will help make DART available in the most recent tagged CESM versions
        which have the most recent CESM component versions. </LI>
</UL>
<P>
These have been exploited most fully in the CAM interfaces to DART,
since the other components' interfaces still use older CESMs.
The cam-fv/shell_scripts can be used as a template for updating 
other models' scripting.
The multi-cycling capability, with the short- and long-term archivers
running as separate jobs at the end, results in assimilation jobs 
which rapidly fill the scratch space.  
Cam-fv's and pop's assimilate.csh scripts have code to remove 
older and unneeded CESM restart file sets during the run.
All of DART's output and user selected, restart file sets are preserved.
</P>

<P>
DART's manhattan release includes the change to hard-wired input and output
filenames in filter.  Cam-fv's assimilate.csh renames these files into
the CESM file format: <br>
$case.$component{_$instance}.$filetype.$date.nc.<br>
DART's hard-wired names are used as new filetypes, just like CESM's existing
"r", "h0", etc.
For example, preassim_mean.nc from a CAM assimilation named Test0 will be renamed <br>
Test0.cam.preassim_mean.2013-03-14-21600.nc <br>
The obs_seq files remain an exception to this renaming, 
since they are not in NetCDF format (yet).
</P>

<A NAME="CESM MODES"></A>
<H2>CESM Component Combinations</H2>

<P>
CESM can be configured with many combinations of its components
(CAM, CLM, POP, CICE, ...) some of which may be 'data' components,
which merely read in data from some external source and
pass it to the other, active, components to use.
The components influence each other only through the coupler.
There are several modes of assimilating observations in this context.
</P>

<H4>Single-Component Assimilation</H4>
<P>
The first, and simplest, consists of assimilating relevant observations
into one active component.
Most/all of the rest of the components are 'data'.
For example, observations of the oceans can be assimilated
into the POP model state, while the atmospheric forcing of
the ocean comes from CAM re-analysis files, and is not changed
by the observations.
A variation of this is used by CAM assimilations.
A CAM forecast usually uses an active land component (CLM)
as well as an active atmospheric component.
Atmospheric observations are assimilated only into the CAM state,
while the land state is modified only through its interactions
with CAM through the coupler.
Each of these assimilations is handled by one of
$DART/models/{cam-fv, pop, clm, ...}
If you want to use an unusual combination of active and data
components, you may need to (work with us to) modify the
setup scripts.
</P>

    <P>
       It's also possible to assimilate observations into multiple
       active components, but restricting the impact of observations
       to only "their own" component.  So in a "coupled" CESM with
       active CAM and POP, atmospheric observations change
       only the CAM model state while oceanic observations change
       only the POP model state.
       This mode uses multiple DART models; cam-fv and pop in this example
       to make a filter for each model.

    <P>
       Work is underway to enable the assimilation of all
       observations into multiple active CESM components.
       So observations of the atmosphere would directly change
       the POP state variables and vice versa.
       Some unresolved issues include defining the "distance"
       between an observation in the atmosphere and a grid
       point in the ocean (for localization), and how frequently 
       to assimilate in CAM versus POP.
       This mode will use code in this models/CESM directory.

<HR>
<H2>Assimilation Set-up Procedure</H2>
<P>
Here is a list of steps to set up an assimilation from scratch,
except that it assumes you have downloaded DART and learned how to
use it with low order models.
Some of the steps can be skipped if you have a suitable replacement, as noted.
</P>

<BR>

<!-- <A href="http://www2.image.ucar.edu/forms/dart-software-download">download site</A>.  </LI> -->
<OL TYPE=1>   
   <LI>
       Decide which component(s) you want to use as the assimilating model(s).
       (The rest of this example assumes that you're building a cam-fv assimilation.)
       Look in models/cam-fv/shell_scripts to see which CESM versions are supported.
   </LI>
   <LI>
       CESM: locate that version on your system, or check it out from
       http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/current.html

   </LI>
   <LI>
       Choose a start date for your assimilation.
       Choosing/creating the initial ensemble is a complicated issue.
       <UL>
          <LI>
              It's simpler for CAM assimilations.
              If you don't have an initial state and/or ensemble for this date,
              build a single instance of CESM (Fxxxx compset for cam-fv) and run it
              from the default Jan 1 start date until 2-4 weeks before your start date.
              Be sure to set the cam namelist variable inithist = 'ENDOFRUN' during
              the last stage, so that CAM will write an "initial" file, which DART needs.
          </LI>
          <LI> 
              For ocean and land assimilations,which use an ensemble of data atmospheres,
              creating usable initial ensemble is a different process.
          </LI>
       </UL>
   </LI>
   <LI>
       Put the entire cam-fv restart file set (including the initial file)
       where it won't be scrubbed before you want to use it.
       Create a pseudo-ensemble by linking files with instance numbers in them
       to the restart file set (which has no instance number) using
       CESM/shell_scripts/link_ens_to_single.csh
   </LI>
   <LI>
       Choose the options in $dart/mkmf/mkmf.template that are best for your assimilation.
       These will not affect the CESM build, only filter.
   </LI>
   <LI>
       In models/cam-fv/work/input.nml, be sure to include
       all of your required obs_def_${platform}_mod.f90 file names in
       preprocess_nml:input_files.
       It's also useful to modify the rest of input.nml to make it
       do what you want for the first assimilation cycle.
       This input.nml will be copied to the $case_root directory and used by
       assimilate.csh.
   </LI>
   <LI>
       Build the DART executables using quickbuild.csh.
   </LI>
   <LI>
       Follow the directions in models/cam-fv/shell_scripts/cesm#_#/setup_hybrid
       to set up the assimilation and build of CESM.  We recommend a tiny ensemble
       to start with, to more quickly test whether everything is in order.
   </LI>
   <LI>
       After convincing yourself that the CESM+DART framework is working with no_assimilate.csh,
       activate the assimilation by changing CESM's env_run.xml:DATA_ASSIMILATION_SCRIPT
       to use assimilate.csh.
   </LI>
   <LI>
       After the first forecast+assimilation cycle finishes correctly,
       change the input.nml, env_run.xml and env_batch.xml to do additional cycle(s)
       without the perturbation of the initial state, and with using the just created
       restart files.  You may also want to turn on the st_archive program.
       Instructions are in setup_hybrid and cam-fv/work/input.nml.
   </LI>
   <LI>
       Finally, build a new case with the full ensemble, activate the assimilate.csh script
       and repeat the steps in step 10.

<A NAME="INITIALFILES"></A>
<HR>
<H2>CAM Initial Ensembles</H2>
<P>

Strategies for generating an initial ensemble from which DART can start.
<BR>

<OL TYPE=1>
<LI> MINIMAL WORK; Get an ensemble of CAM/CLM/CICE/POP/... initial and restart files
     from someone else (DART has a few dates for a few model cores and resolutions
     <A HREF="http://www.image.ucar.edu/pub/DART/Obs_sets">here</A>.
     This limits the investigations you can undertake,
     but is the fastest and cheapest way to start assimilating.
</LI>

<LI> MINIMAL CAM COMPUTING; an assimilation can be started from a single CAM (+CLM[+CICE])
     initial file.  
     The single model state is randomly perturbed to make as many ensemble members
     as are requested in the <em class=code>ens_size</em> variable 
     in the <em class=code>filter_nml</em> namelist.
     Create a <em class=file>filter_ic </em> file from the CAM initial file (dart_to_cam.f90).
     Create an <em class=file>obs_seq.out </em> file which has a single observation 
     with a large observational error variance, 
     valid at least a week after the start date for the spin-up.
     This will make the ensemble advance long enough to balance the fields,
     without being perturbed by the assimilation of any observations.
<PRE>
&amp;filter_nml
   ...
   start_from_restart       = .false.,
   restart_in_file_name     = "filter_ic",
   ...
/
&amp;model_nml
   ...
   pert_names         = 'T       ','US      ','VS      '
   pert_sd           = 1.0d0,2.0d0,2.0d0
   ...
/
</PRE>
Note that <em class=code>start_from_restart</em> is false 
("don't start from a pre-existing *ensemble*"), 
but a restart file (<em class=file>filter_ic</em>) 
is still needed for filter to have something realistic to perturb.
<em class=code>pert_names</em> specifies which fields will be perturbed.  
CAM field names are used.
<em class=code>pert_sd</em> > 0 allows each point of the pert_names fields of each ensemble member
to be randomly perturbed with a standard deviation of pert_sd.
Other fields can be used, but moisture variables are tricky because of their variation
with height by orders of magnitude.  
Regardless of which fields are specified, the spin-up period
will allow the fields to come into balance with respect to the model, 
so the perturbations will propagate into all fields.
</LI>

<LI>
FULL FUNCTION ENSEMBLE; In order to have, on hand, initial ensembles
of any practical size, for any date of the year, we recommend the following.
Scripts for doing this are available in .../DART/models/cam/make_ensemble.
See the README there for more details.
They are not highly documented or elegent, but offer a starting point.
Make 20 successive 1-year free CAM runs (MPI CAM highly recommended, NO_LEAP calender), 
saving the initial files every 5 days. ? ?  Or 5 years, saving every day.
Then pull together all of the, e.g., Jan 6ths (00Z) into a 20 (5) member ensemble
(numbered 1...20(5)).
<UL> 
When you need an ensemble of, say 60 members for June 1 
then retrieve the 20 members from each of May 26, May 31, and June 5,
renumbering them 1,...,60.
