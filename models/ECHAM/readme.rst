ECHAM
=====

Overview
--------

`ECHAM <https://mpimet.mpg.de/en/science/models/mpi-esm/echam>`_ is the
atmospheric general circulation component of the `Max Planck Institute Earth
System Model (MPI-ESM) <https://mpimet.mpg.de/en/science/models/mpi-esm>`_. It
was originally branched from the numerical weather prediction model developed
by the `European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)
<https://www.ecmwf.int/>`_
in the late 1980's and is developed and supported by the `Max Planck Institute
for Meteorology <https://mpimet.mpg.de/>`_ in Hamburg, Germany. Thus the ECHAM
acronym is comprised of EC from ECMWF, H for Hamburg and AM for atmospheric
model.

There are several DART users who have working DART interface code to ECHAM. If
you are interested in running DART with this model please contact the DART
group at `dart@ucar.edu <dart@ucar.edu>`_ for more information.  We currently
do not have a copy of the model_mod interface code nor any of the scripting
required to run an assimilation, but we may be able to put you in contact with
the right people to get it.
