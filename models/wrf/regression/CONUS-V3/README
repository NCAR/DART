This is a WRF 3.1 regression test case, which can be used to test 
that code changes do not break existing functions, as well as testing
a wrf/dart initial setup.

The domain is CONUS (the continental United States), 120 km resolution. 

The observation files are the standard prepbufr NCEP observations, from 2008/05/22-24.

The initial condition and boundary files are generated by the accompanying shell
script using V3 real.exe and wrfvar. Ensemble BC files are generated 'on-the-fly'
with the current configuration. 

You can select how many ensemble members you want to do, by default this is
set to 32.

The smaller files are here in this directory. It is suggested that new users
build the input files from scratch following guidance in the WRF-DART wiki. 
Send an e-mail to dart@ucar.edu to access the wiki site if you are not currently
a subscriber. Otherwise, the large data files (observations, WPS processed files 
and run output) are on the DART web server, at this http address:

Input files you need to run the test:

obs_seq.out (on web site)      
met_em.d01*.nc (on web site)
icbc_real.ksh (copy from this directory)

Executables you will need to build from the DART/WRF distribution:

dart_to_wrf, wrf_to_dart - translates from WRF netcdf files to DART restart, and back
filter - the main DART assimilation program
wakeup_filter - only needed if you must run WRF in parallel mode


Shell scripts that come with the DART/WRF distribution:

runme_filter - shell script that starts the job
quickbuild.sh - shell script that builds all the executables.  run it with
                 the single argument nompi if you want to compile without mpi.
advance_model.csh - needed to advance the WRF model


Files which are on the web site to validate your results:
