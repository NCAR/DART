This directory contains a collection of WRF/DART test cases.   They are intended to
be full WRF runs, possibly too large for smaller workstations.  They cover different
aspects of the way WRF is run -- regional vs global, different boundary conditions,
different WRF configurations and different contents of the DART state vector.
Sincere thanks to the users who have contributed these files. 

Each subdirectory has a README file with more details on the specifics
of the case.  Most test cases need large data files, which are not stored
in the subversion repository.  There are pointers in the README files for
the location of where to download the data.

The current contents are:

CONUS-V2: WRF Version 2, continental US.
CONUS-V3: WRF Version 3, continental US.
Global-V3: WRF Version 3, Global 
Radar: WRF Version 2, surface radar obs
