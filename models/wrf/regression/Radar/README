This is a WRF 3.0.1.1 regression test case, which can be used to test
that code changes do not break existing functions, as well as testing
a wrf/dart initial setup.

This is a regional model, using surface radar observations.

The smaller files are here in this directory.

The large data files (observations, initial conditions and WRF executable
for a Mac Intel platform) are on the DART web server, at this http address:
