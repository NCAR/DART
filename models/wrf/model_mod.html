<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>
DART interface module for the WRF model.  This page documents the details of
the module compiled into DART that interfaces with the WRF data in
the state vector. There is additional overview and tutorial documentation
for running a WRF/DART assimilation on this web page:
</P>
<P>
<a href="http://www.image.ucar.edu/wrfdart/tutorial">
http://www.image.ucar.edu/wrfdart/tutorial</a>
</P>
<P>
The <em class=program>model_mod</em> reads WRF netCDF files directly to acquire
the model state data. The <em class=program>wrf_to_dart</em> and <em class=program>dart_to_wrf</em> programs are no longer necessary. 
<br />
<br />
A netCDF file named <em class=file>wrfinput_d01</em> is required 
and must be at the same resolution and have the same surface elevation
data as the files converted to create the DART initial conditions.  No data
will be read from this file, but the grid information must match exactly.
</P>
<P>
The model interface code supports WRF configurations with multiple domains.  
Data for all
domains is read into the DART state vector.  During the computation of the
forward operators (getting the estimated observation values from each
ensemble member), the search starts in the domain with the highest number,
which is generally the finest nest or one of multiple finer nests.
The search stops as soon as a domain contains the observation location,
working its way from largest number to smallest number domain, ending
with domain 1.
For example, in a 4 domain case the data in the state vector that came 
from <em class=file>wrfinput_d04</em> is searched first, then
<em class=file>wrfinput_d03</em>, <em class=file>wrfinput_d02</em>, 
and finally
<em class=file>wrfinput_d01</em>.
The forward operator is computed from the first domain grid that
contains the lat/lon of the observation.   
During the assimilation phase, when the state values are adjusted based on 
the correlations and assimilation increments, all points in all domains 
that are within the localization radius are adjusted, regardless of domain.
The impact of an observation on the state depends only on the distance between
the observation and the state vector point, and the regression coefficient 
based on the correlation between the distributions of the ensemble of state 
vector points and the ensemble of observation forward operator values.
</P>
<P>
The fields from WRF that are copied into the DART state vector are
controlled by namelist.  See below for the documentation on the &amp;model_nml
entries.  The state vector should include all fields needed to restart
a WRF run.  There may be additional fields needed depending on the
microphysics scheme selected.  See the ascii file <em class=file>wrf_state_variables_table</em>
in the <em class=file>models/wrf</em> directory for a list of
fields that are often included in the DART state.
</P>
<P>
The 18 public interfaces
are standardized for all DART compliant models. These interfaces allow
DART to advance the model, get the model state and metadata describing 
this state, find state variables that are close to a given location, 
and do spatial interpolation for a variety of variables required in
observational operators.

# Notes for model_nml:
# (1) vert_localization_coord must be one of:
#     1 = model level
#     2 = pressure
#     3 = height
#     4 = scale height
# (2) see bottom of this file for explanations of polar, periodic_x, 
#     periodic_y, and scm
# (3) calendar = 3 is GREGORIAN, which is what WRF uses.
# (4) if 'default_state_variables' is .true. the model_mod.f90 code will
#     fill the state variable table with the following wrf vars: 
#        U, V, W, PH, T, MU
#     you must set it to false before you change the value 
#     of 'wrf_state_variables' and have it take effect.
# (5) the format for 'wrf_state_variables' is an array of 5 strings:
#     wrf netcdf variable name, dart QTY_xxx string, type string (must be 
#     unique, will soon be obsolete, we hope), 'UPDATE', and '999' if the 
#     array is part of all domains.  otherwise, it is a string with the domain
#     numbers (e.g. '12' for domains 1 and 2, '13' for domains 1 and 3).
#   example:
# wrf_state_variables='U','QTY_U_WIND_COMPONENT','TYPE_U','UPDATE','999',
#                     'V','QTY_V_WIND_COMPONENT','TYPE_V','UPDATE','999',
#                     'W','QTY_VERTICAL_VELOCITY','TYPE_W','UPDATE','999',
#                     'T','QTY_POTENTIAL_TEMPERATURE','TYPE_T','UPDATE','999',
#                     'PH','QTY_GEOPOTENTIAL_HEIGHT','TYPE_GZ','UPDATE','999',
#                     'MU','QTY_PRESSURE','TYPE_MU','UPDATE','999',

#                     'Q2','QTY_SPECIFIC_HUMIDITY','TYPE_Q2','UPDATE','999',
#                     'PSFC','QTY_PRESSURE','TYPE_PS','UPDATE','999',
# (6) the format for 'wrf_state_bounds' is an array of 4 strings:
#     wrf netcdf variable name, minimum value, maximum value, and either
#     FAIL or CLAMP.  FAIL will halt the program if an out of range value
#     is detected.  CLAMP will set out of range values to the min or max.
#     The special string 'NULL' will map to plus or minus infinity and will
#     not change the values.  arrays not listed in this table will not
#     be changed as they are read or written.
#
#
# polar and periodic_x are used in global wrf.  if polar is true, the 
# grid interpolation routines will wrap over the north and south poles.  
# if periodic_x is true, when the east and west edges of the grid are
# reached the interpolation will wrap.  note this is a separate issue
# from regional models which cross the GMT line; those grids are marked
# as having a negative offset and do not need to wrap; this flag controls
# what happens when the edges of the grid are reached.

# the scm flag is used for the 'single column model' version of WRF.
# it needs the periodic_x and periodic_y flags set to true, in which
# case the X and Y directions are periodic; no collapsing of the grid
# into a single location like the 3d-spherical polar flag implies.

        The 5 strings are:  
<OL><LI>WRF field name - must match netcdf name exactly</LI>
    <LI>DART KIND name - must match a valid DART QTY_xxx exactly</LI>
    <LI>TYPE_NN - will hopefully be obsolete, but for now NN

<!-- Description -->

<P>
Given a model state, produces an ensemble of model states that are somehow different.
This is used to generate initial ensemble conditions perturbed around some control
trajectory state when one is preparing to spin-up ensembles.
<br />
<br />
<em class=program>pert_model_copies</em> is presently not encouraged for WRF.
The initial ensemble has to be generated off-line. If coherent structures are 
not required, the filter can generate an ensemble with uncorrelated random 
Gaussian noise of 0.002. This is of course not appropriate for a model like 
WRF which has variables expressed in a wide range of scales.
It is thus recommended to generate the initial ensemble off-line, 
perhaps with the tools provided in <em class=file>models/wrf/PERTURB/3DVAR-COVAR</em>.
<br />
<br />
This topic is also covered in the 
<a href="http://www.image.ucar.edu/wrfdart/tutorial">WRF-DART tutorial</a>.
<br />
<br />
Generally you do not want to just perturb a single state to begin an
experiment, especially for a regional weather model, because the 
resulting fields will have spread but they won't have organized features.
we have had good luck with some global atmosphere models where there is
a lot of model divergence; after a few days of running they evolve into
plausible conditions that allow assimilation of real obs.
<br />
<br />
If you really need to start with a single state and proceed, the suggestion
is to start with small magnitude perturbations and then get a good ensemble
of boundary conditions and run the model for a while (many days) to let it
evolve into plausible weather patterns.  Then start assimilating real obs.
<br />
<br />
Using this routine requires you to set the new namelist item 
<em class=code>allow_perturbed_ics = .true.</em> so you have to read the 
warnings here or in the source code.
<br />
<br />
This code will add random noise field by field (T, U, V, etc), and new values
will not exceed the original max or min values for each field.  This means
it will not generate illegal values (e.g. negatives for percentages or
number concentrations) but it also means that if all values in a field are
identical (e.g. all 0.0) this routine will not change those values.  The code
can easily be modified to set allowed min and max values here instead of
using the incoming field min and max values; but you will have to modify
the code to enable that functionality.

<H2>KNOWN BUGS</H2>
<P>
Only the Lambert projection (MAP_PROJ = 1) is working. Other map projections
(0=none, 2=polar, 3=Mercator) are likely to break the code.
