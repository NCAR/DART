Overview
========

DART interface module for the WRF model. This page documents the details of the
module compiled into DART that interfaces with the WRF data in the state vector.

WRF+DART Tutorial
=================

**There is additional overview and tutorial documentation for running a WRF/DART
assimilation in** ``./tutorial/README.md`` **.**

Please work through the tutorial in order to learn how to run WRF and DART.

Items of Note
-------------

- The ``model_mod`` reads WRF netCDF files directly to acquire the model state
  data. The ``wrf_to_dart`` and ``dart_to_wrf`` programs are no longer
  necessary.
- A netCDF file named ``wrfinput_d01`` is required and must be at the same
  resolution and have the same surface elevation data as the files converted to
  create the DART initial conditions. No data will be read from this file, but
  the grid information must match exactly.

The model interface code supports WRF configurations with multiple domains. Data
for all domains is read into the DART state vector. During the computation of
the forward operators (getting the estimated observation values from each
ensemble member), the search starts in the domain with the highest number, which
is generally the finest nest or one of multiple finer nests. The search stops as
soon as a domain contains the observation location, working its way from largest
number to smallest number domain, ending with domain 1. For example, in a 4
domain case the data in the state vector that came from ``wrfinput_d04`` is
searched first, then ``wrfinput_d03``, ``wrfinput_d02``, and finally 
``wrfinput_d01``.

The forward operator is computed from the first domain grid that contains the
lat/lon of the observation. During the assimilation phase, when the state values
are adjusted based on the correlations and assimilation increments, all points
in all domains that are within the localization radius are adjusted, regardless
of domain. The impact of an observation on the state depends only on the
distance between the observation and the state vector point, and the regression
coefficient based on the correlation between the distributions of the ensemble
of state vector points and the ensemble of observation forward operator values.

The fields from WRF that are copied into the DART state vector are controlled by
namelist. See below for the documentation on the &model_nml entries. The state
vector should include all fields needed to restart a WRF run. There may be
additional fields needed depending on the microphysics scheme selected. See the
ascii file ``wrf_state_variables_table`` in the ``models/wrf`` directory for a
list of fields that are often included in the DART state.

Namelist
========

The ``&model_nml`` namelist is read from the ``input.nml`` file. Namelists
start with an ampersand ``&`` and terminate with a slash ``/``. Character
strings that contain a ``/`` must be enclosed in quotes to prevent them from
prematurely terminating the namelist.

      # Notes for model_nml:
      # (1) vert_localization_coord must be one of:
      #     1 = model level
      #     2 = pressure
      #     3 = height
      #     4 = scale height
      # (2) see bottom of this file for explanations of polar, periodic_x, 
      #     periodic_y, and scm
      # (3) calendar = 3 is GREGORIAN, which is what WRF uses.
      # (4) if 'default_state_variables' is .true. the model_mod.f90 code will
      #     fill the state variable table with the following wrf vars: 
      #        U, V, W, PH, T, MU
      #     you must set it to false before you change the value 
      #     of 'wrf_state_variables' and have it take effect.
      # (5) the format for 'wrf_state_variables' is an array of 5 strings:
      #     wrf netcdf variable name, dart QTY_xxx string, type string (must be 
      #     unique, will soon be obsolete, we hope), 'UPDATE', and '999' if the 
      #     array is part of all domains.  otherwise, it is a string with the domain
      #     numbers (e.g. '12' for domains 1 and 2, '13' for domains 1 and 3).
      #   example:
      # wrf_state_variables='U','QTY_U_WIND_COMPONENT','TYPE_U','UPDATE','999',
      #                     'V','QTY_V_WIND_COMPONENT','TYPE_V','UPDATE','999',
      #                     'W','QTY_VERTICAL_VELOCITY','TYPE_W','UPDATE','999',
      #                     'T','QTY_POTENTIAL_TEMPERATURE','TYPE_T','UPDATE','999',
      #                     'PH','QTY_GEOPOTENTIAL_HEIGHT','TYPE_GZ','UPDATE','999',
      #                     'MU','QTY_PRESSURE','TYPE_MU','UPDATE','999',
      #                     'QVAPOR','QTY_VAPOR_MIXING_RATIO','TYPE_QV','UPDATE','999',
      #                     'QCLOUD','QTY_CLOUD_LIQUID_WATER','TYPE_QC','UPDATE','999',

      #                     'U10','QTY_U_WIND_COMPONENT','TYPE_U10','UPDATE','999',
      #                     'V10','QTY_V_WIND_COMPONENT','TYPE_V10','UPDATE','999',
      #                     'T2','QTY_TEMPERATURE','TYPE_T2','UPDATE','999',
      #                     'TH2','QTY_POTENTIAL_TEMPERATURE','TYPE_TH2','UPDATE','999',
      #                     'Q2','QTY_SPECIFIC_HUMIDITY','TYPE_Q2','UPDATE','999',
      #                     'PSFC','QTY_PRESSURE','TYPE_PS','UPDATE','999',
      # (6) the format for 'wrf_state_bounds' is an array of 4 strings:
      #     wrf netcdf variable name, minimum value, maximum value, and either
      #     FAIL or CLAMP.  FAIL will halt the program if an out of range value
      #     is detected.  CLAMP will set out of range values to the min or max.
      #     The special string 'NULL' will map to plus or minus infinity and will
      #     not change the values.  arrays not listed in this table will not
      #     be changed as they are read or written.
      #
      #
      # polar and periodic_x are used in global wrf.  if polar is true, the 
      # grid interpolation routines will wrap over the north and south poles.  
      # if periodic_x is true, when the east and west edges of the grid are
      # reached the interpolation will wrap.  note this is a separate issue
      # from regional models which cross the GMT line; those grids are marked
      # as having a negative offset and do not need to wrap; this flag controls
      # what happens when the edges of the grid are reached.

      # the scm flag is used for the 'single column model' version of WRF.
      # it needs the periodic_x and periodic_y flags set to true, in which
      # case the X and Y directions are periodic; no collapsing of the grid
      # into a single location like the 3d-spherical polar flag implies.

The following items used to be in the WRF namelist but have been removed. The
first 4 are no longer needed, and the last one was moved to the
``&dart_to_wrf_nml`` namelist in 2010. In the Lanai release having these values
in the namelist does not cause a fatal error, but more recent versions of the
code will fail if any of these values are specified. Remove them from your
namelist to avoid errors.
