Overview
========

The 9-variable model is described in Lorenz (1980). [1]_ Lorenz developed this
primitive-equation model using shallow-water equations as a starting point and
manipulating the divergence equations so that the model exhibits
quasi-geostrophic behavior and transient gravity waves that dissipate with
time. Gent and McWilliams (1982) [2]_ explore the behavior of this model
extensively. For an introduction to shallow-water equations, we recommend
consulting the relevant section of a meteorology textbook such as section 4.5
of Holton and Hakim (2013). [3]_

The model's three *X* variables are at 0, 1/9, and 2/9, three *Y* variables are
at 3/9, 4/9 and 5/9, and three *Z* variables are at 6/9, 7/9, and 8/9 on a
cyclic [0, 1] domain.

In the 9-variable model, DART advances the model, gets the model state and
metadata describing this state. The model can be configured by altering the
``&model_nml`` `namelist`_ in the ``input.nml`` file. The details of the
``&model_nml`` namelist are always model-specific (there are no generic
namelist values). The model time step defaults to 1 hour (3600 seconds) but is
settable by altering the namelist.

The 9-variable model has a ``work/workshop_setup.csh`` script that compiles 
and runs an example. This example is referenced in Sections 7 and 10 of the
`DART_tutorial <https://dart.ucar.edu/pages/Tutorial.html>`__
and is intended to provide insight into model/assimilation behavior.
The example **may or may not** result in good (*or even decent!*) results!

Namelist
========

The ``&model_nml`` namelist is read from the ``input.nml`` file. Namelists
start with an ampersand ``&`` and terminate with a slash ``/``. Character
strings that contain a ``/`` must be enclosed in quotes to prevent them from
prematurely terminating the namelist.
