<H2> Modes and scripts for running filter and perfect_model_obs </H2>

</TABLE>

<P>
In the filter the model can be advanced and the assimilation performed 
each in 3 different modes.
The mode of the model advance is specified by the variable "async" in the 
filter_nml namelist in file input.nml.  
The mode of the assimilation is specified by the variable "do_parallel"
in the assim_tools_nml namelist.
Both variables are of type integer and can have the value 0, 2, or 3.
(update for MPI)
</P>

<P>
async = 0 <BR>
---------
</P>

<P>
This mode should and can only be used with low-order models, 
which will be advanced by calls to a subroutine within filter. 
The filter is run in synchronous mode and is launched by executing
</P>

<P>
"filter"
</P>



<P>
async = 1 (obsolete) <BR>
---------
</P>

<P>
In this asynchronous mode, both the c-shell script and the fortran program "filter" run
simultaneously.  It can be used by low-order or large models.
The filter is launched by executing
</P>

<P>
"async_filter.csh | filter"
</P>

<P>
The c-shell script waits for a file called "async_may_go" that
is created by the filter. Once the filter has created the "async_may_go" file,
the filter waits for async_filter.csh to finish. The script
async_filter.csh executes another c-shell script called "advance_ens.csh", which
advances the model and is described below. Then async_filter.csh 
removes the file "async_may_go", and signals that the filter can proceed (remember 
that the output of async_filter.csh is piped into the filter). Finally, async_filter.csh
does a recursive call to itself to proceed to the next observation time in the
obs_seq.out file.
</P>

<P>
"async_filter.csh" resides in DART/shell_scripts.
</P>


<P>
async = 2 <BR>
---------
</P>

<P>
This mode is intended to advance large models in a multiprocessor environment.
In this mode, the filter is executed with
</P>

<P>
"filter"
</P>

<P>
and the filter executes a system call which advances the model ensemble. The system
call is specified in the file input.nml, in the namelists filter_nml and 
perfect_model_obs_nml, variable "adv_ens_command".  The command can be a direct
call to the c-shell script "advance_ens.csh", or some other suitable command
such as "qsub -l nodes=8 advance_ens.csh" in a batch submission environment.
</P>


<P>
The c-shell script "advance_ens.csh" (resides in DART/shell_scripts).
--------------------------------------------------------------------
</P>

<P>
The same c-shell script "advance_ens.csh" can be used with any of the available
models in DART but remains platform-specific. This script should be adapted to
the machine architecture and environment when DART is installed.  Currently it
can be called directly, in which case the computing resources (i.e. number and names 
of the processors) to use are specified in the script and the job runs interactively.  
Or the advance_ens.csh can be passed to qsub, which will handle the allocation of 
computing resources, and the job will run in batch mode. Other batch submission 
commands will require more extensive changes to advance_ens.csh.
Model specific funtions should not be performed in this script, if possible.
</P>


<P>
The c-shell script "advance_model.csh" (resides in DART/models/"model"/shell_scripts).
--------------------------------------------------------------------
</P>

<P>
For each ensemble member to be integrated forward in time, "advance_ens.csh" calls
another c-shell script called "advance_model.csh". There should be a different
"advance_model.csh" for each different model. Presently, "advance_model.csh" is
available for the Lorenz-96 model in DART/models/lorenz_96/shell_scripts 
(this copy can also be used with the other available low-order models).
The contents of advance_model.csh will depend entirely on the model being used; 
its I/O requirements, pre-existing scripts, etc.  (as well as the shell environment).  
Platform specific functions should not be performed in this script, if possible.
