These scripts are executed using the async = 3 and do_parallel = 3
options in the namelist file input.nml.
These will advance the ensemble of models states on a set of processors,
and then divide the globe into regions and assimilate each region on a processor.
They are designed for use on a multi-processor machine, and have been tested for
a batch submission environments PBS and LSF on Linux clusters.

<BR><BR>

The strategy of this set of scripts for doing an assimilation follows.
The functionality of each has been restricted to one domain; a script
is specific to only a machine where the experiment is run, to a model used
in the assimilation, to the filter version, or to the experiment being conducted
using the choices for the previous 3.

     number within the series of obs_seq.out files,
     i.e. 01_02 for the second obs_seq.final of a January case.

A typical pathname for a restart file in my case would be:
/scratch/cluster/raeder/T21x80/Taper1/01_03/DART/filter_ic
                        |      |      |     DART restart file directory
                        |      |      Obs_seq (Jan 3)
                        |      Experiment (reduced influence of obs above 150 hPa)
                        Central directory (resolution x num_ens_members)
</pre>

You may also want to make a subdirectory within Experiment 
for each set of obs_space postscript files created by obs_diag and matlab.

<H2>HELPFUL HINTS</H2>
<P>

Use the ensemble size, available compute nodes, and processors/node  to figure how many
nodes to request.  Make this request in filter_server.csh.  For example,  on a machine with
2 processors/node, and running an assimilation with a 
typical ensemble of 40 members, it's efficient to request 5 nodes.
This will advance CAM in 4 batches of 10 (1 CAM/processor).  Then set the number of domains in 
the assimilation to be num_nodes x procs/node (10), so each domain will execute on a 
single processor.  Setting the number of domains to be large (40) is not efficient because
in this current (Iceland) parallel mode the computation does not scale well.


<BR><BR>

If you're not running job.csh as a batch job,
run it as 'nohup ./job.csh >& /dev/null &', to protect the job from being cutoff
by the closure of the window in which it was executed.

<BR><BR>

Modify and use alias 'rmtemp' to remove the temporary files from
the central directory where the experiment is run, before running another experiment.
<pre>
alias rmtemp 'rm *_ud* *_ic[1-9]* cam_*_temp* c[al]minput_[1-9]*.nc filter_assim_region_* \
              *control filter_ic_old* obs_seq.out times'
</pre>
Needless to say, be careful that you don't name files you want to keep in such a way that
they'll be deleted by this.

<BR><BR>

Each batch of restart data can be saved to a mass store using (a modified) 
auto_re2ms and retrieved using .../ms2restart.  Execute the
commands with no arguments to see instructions.  They package files of each ensemble
member together, and then bundle batches of ensemble members together for efficient
storage in a directory named similarly to the one where they exist on the cluster.
