Overview
========

The Lorenz 96 2-scale model was first described by Edward Lorenz during a
seminar at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts in the Autumn
of 1995, the proceedings of which were published as Lorenz (1996) [1]_ the
following year, hence the model is commonly referred to as Lorenz 96.

The model state varies on two separate time scales, one for the X dimension and
another in the Y dimension. It is constructed by coupling together two
implementations of the Lorenz 96 single-scale model. The constant *F* term in
Lorenz 96 single-scale model is replaced by a term that couples the two scales
together.

Lorenz 96 2-scale is a widely studied model because the differing timescales
can be viewed as an analog of processes that occur on different time and
spatial scales in the atmosphere such as large-scale flow and localized
convection. The `references`_ contain some of the earlier studies including
Palmer (2001), [2]_ Smith (2001), [3]_ Orrell (2002), [4]_ Orrel (2003), [5]_
Vannitsem and Toth (2002), [6]_ Roulston and Smith (2003), [7]_ and Wilks
(2005). [8]_

The Lorenz 96 2-scale model has a ``work/workshop_setup.csh`` script that 
compiles and runs an example. This example may be explored in the
`DART_tutorial <https://dart.ucar.edu/pages/Tutorial.html>`__
and is intended to provide insight into model/assimilation behavior.
The example **may or may not** result in good (*or even decent!*) results!

Development History
-------------------

This DART model interface was developed by Josh Hacker as an adaptation of 
Tim Hoar's Lorenz 96 implementation. The 2-scale model is the second model
described in Lorenz (1996).

Quick Start
===========

To run Lorenz 96 2-scale with its default settings:

1. Ensure you have the correct settings in mkmf.template in
   ``<DARTROOT>/build_templates/mkmf.template``
2. Build the DART executables using the ``quickbuild.csh`` script in the
   ``./work`` directory.
3. Once the executables have been built, the two Perl scripts provided in the
   ``./shell_scripts`` directory, ``spinup_model.pl`` and ``run_expt.pl``, can
   be used to spin up the model and run an experiment.

Namelist
========

The model also implements the variant of Smith (2001), which can be invoked by
setting ``local_y = .true.`` in the ``&model_nml`` namelist in the
``input.nml`` file.

The ``&model_nml`` namelist is read from the ``input.nml`` file. Namelists
start with an ampersand ``&`` and terminate with a slash ``/``. Character
strings that contain a ``/`` must be enclosed in quotes to prevent them from
prematurely terminating the namelist.
