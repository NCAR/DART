Dynamo interface to DART
========================
Goal of this interface is to estimate the time variation of velocities to
match given spatio-temporal observation of magnetic fields. Key points to
note:

1. A small number of time varying parameters need to be reconstructed, so

2. async = 2 is chosen i.e. both filter and model is serial, however

3. advance_model spawns ens_size (20) number of model instances concurrently
   with small variation/reorganization in distributed version of this script.

4. At each invocation of advance_model, 

     (a) first the model is advanced starting from the restart file of
         previous iteration. (executable dyn.out)

     (b) Again the model is advanced with small variation in input vector 
         from the same restart as in (a) (executable dyn.out) to evaluate

   the numerically the 1st derivative of observation (executable x_plus_delta
   and dobsdx) to be used by model_interpolate particularly to evaluate 
   posterior observation value. (output file: obsval.dat.$ens_num)

5. After that input vector is perturbed adding a small amplitude of Gaussian
   noise (executable gau_param) and then dart_to_model converts this for filter.
