This code is currently being converted from Lanai to Manhattan.

It also will need some changes to support regional GITM grids.

The original code used a gitm_to_dart program to read in each block,
one per task, and combine them into a single state vector.

We will need a replacement for this program that combines the data
into a single netcdf variable.

In the meantime, I have regional data where the per-task-blocks
have already been combined into a single file. the 'gitm_to_netcdf.f90'
program reads this combined file and creates an output netcdf file.

The model_mod.f90 was converted enough to build, but the get_close_obs()
routine will need fixing, and it needs: get_close_state() and the two
vertical convert routines added.  (right now they include the default
module versions which do nothing but satisfy the compiler.)
