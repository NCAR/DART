\f0\fs24 \cf0 This folder contains two example output files (2DTEC*bin and 3DUSR*bin) from a WP-GITM run. This particular WP-GITM simulation was the "non-perturbed" run for the March 11, 2011 Tohoku-Oki Tsunami arrival at the US West Coast. In this run, there was no tsunami perturbation. I also produced an identical WP-GITM run with the tsubami perturbation. The difference between the two runs gives the ionospheric disturbances due to the tsunami. The "non-perturbed" and "perturbed" runs have the identical domain size, grid resolution and simulation begin and end times, therefore I only included the output files from the "non-perturbed" run as examples.\
\

\f1\b WP-GITM simulation setting
\f0\b0 \
\
The WP-GITM simulation that generated these two output files was a regional simulation. The simulation started at 14:45UT and ended at 20:45UT on March 11, 2011. The domain covers from 228E to 252E and 30N to 50N horizontally. So it is a local region of 24 degrees in longitude by 20 degrees in latitude. The horizontal grid size is 0.2 degrees in both longitude and latitude. In the vertical direction, the domain covers a typical altitude range that a global GITM simulation would cover. Specifically, for this run, the altitude range is from about 96.7km to about 615.5km. The vertical grid size is 1/3 of the local scale height, therefore it increases with height. \
\
The exact grid point locations in longitude, latitude, and altitude are listed below:\

For the altitude grid, the lowest two grids (at 96.7km and 98.3km in this run) are ghost cells, where the lower boundary conditions of GITM is defined. The lower boundary conditions include the density, velocity, and temperature of neutrals and ions, typically from empirical models. For our application, we only deal with the following variables at the lower boundary: 1) the neutral mass density 2) the eastward, northward, and upward neutral wind and 3) the neutral temperature. From a given tsunami, the WP model will provide perturbations in 1), 2) and 3). These perturbations are added on top of the boundary conditions specified from empirical models. Perturbations in a few other variables are also specified at the lower boundary, but they are all derived from 1) or 2). I will skip the details here for simplicity of this document.\
\
Similar to the vertical direction, there are two layers of ghost cells at each horizontal boundary as well. These are included as the first two and last two grid points in the Longitude and Latitude grid listed above.\

\f1\b Explanation of 3DUSR*bin and 2DTEC*bin files
\f0\b0 \
\
Both files are saved at the end of this particular WP-GITM run, at 20:45UT on March 11, 2011.\
\
3DUSR_t110311_204500.bin contains a 4-D array of size [9, 124, 104, 54]. The first index is for 9 variables in the order of \'93Longitude, Latitude, Altitude, Neutral Density, Electron Density, East Wind, North Wind, Vertical Wind, and Neutral Temperature\'94. The second, third and last indices represent the grid point locations in longitude, latitude, and altitude, respectively. Important Note: the unit for the longitude and latitude is radian, and the unit for the altitude is meter.\

\cf0 2DTEC_t110311_204500.bin contains a 3-D array of size [5,120,100]. The first index is for 5 variables in the order of \'93Longitude, Latitude, Altitude, Solar Zenith Angle, and Vertical TEC\'94. The second and last indices represent the grid point locations in longitude and latitude. The unit for the longitude and latitude is radian. Important Note: the ghost cells at horizontal boundaries are not included in this type of output files. Therefore, there are only 120 grid points in longitude and 100 grid points in latitude. \
