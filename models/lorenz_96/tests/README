The test_merge.ksh script is a self-contained script
that constructs input.nml files and runs merge_obs_seq.

It prints out the test number and output from the run
into a log file, and if the output sequence file is short,
concatenates the entire output file in the log; if it's long,
it prints out the first and last 30 values.

If the test is expected to fail, it has a 'fail' keyword
in the test.   This does test various overlaps of files
and start/stop times, but the checking is far from automated
and it doesn't test a few other things which need testing
like squeezing out unused obs or sorting (which it does but
there's just no specific test for it yet).
