This README was last updated July 14, 2004 by Jim Hansen.  
It is relevant for the Guam release of DART.

The MITgcm model in annulus configuration and its current 
implementation within the DART framework are described
below.

o For details on the MITgcm, read the MODEL section
  below.
o For specifics on how the MITgcm was implemented in the DART
  framework, read the DART section below.
o For a step-by-step tutorial on how to use the model in
  DART, read the EXAMPLE section below.  Please note that
  the tutorial is not meant to be an "operational" implementation
  of the data assimilation scheme, it is designed to be run
  quickly and simply.

MODEL

The MITgcm annulus model as configured for this application
within DART is a non-hydrostatic, rigid lid, C-grid, primitive
equation model utilizing a cylindrical coordinate system.  For 
detailed information about the MITgcm, see http://mitgcm.org.

DART

~/DART/shell_scripts

	o advance_ens_fisher_oneproc.csh

	The advance_ens.csh script is meant to be machine
	dependent.  I didn't like the four processor fisher
	version in ~/DART/shell_scripts, so I modified it to
	a single processor version.

~/DART/location/annulus

	o location_mod.f90

	The location_mod.f90 for the annulus is a modified version
	of ~/DART/location/threed_sphere/location_mod.f90.  The most
	important thing to keep in mind in the annulus version is that
	longitude actually mean azimuthal angle, and latitude actually
	means radius.

~/DART/obs_kind/annulus

	o obs_kind_mod.f90

	The only modification that was made to the default
	obs_kind_mod.f90 was to alter the interactive_kind
	subroutine so that only the five variables passed
	to DART by the MITgcm are made available.

~/DART/models/MITgcm_annulus

	Lots and lots of modifications in this directory!

	o trans_MITgcm_to_dart.f90

	As the name implies, it was necessary to create a
	program to translate between the MITgcm restart file
	and the dart restart file.  This program is called by
	advance_model.csh.

	o trans_dart_to_MITgcm.f90

	This program translates between the dart restart file
	and the MITgcm restart file.  It too is called by
	advance model.csh.  It seems silly to have both this
	program and trans_MITgcm_to_dart.f90, and at some
	point they will probably be combined.

	o trans_perfect_ics.f90

	This program is very similar to trans MITgcm_to_dart.f90.
	It is only used to go from the default initial MITgcm
	state to a dart initial condition file.

	o model_mod.f90

	Where to start!?

	This model_mod.f90 is modified from the lorenz_04
	model_mod.f90.  Thus, there were many many changes
	that were made.

	The default namelist for the annulus is:

	model_size            length of the data assimilation control
        	               vector, and is = naz*nrad*nzed*ntype
	naz                   number of gridpoints in the azimuthal direction
	nrad                  number of gridpoints in the radial direction
	nzed                  number of gridpoints in the z direction
	ntype                 number of variables at each grid point that
	                       are impacted by the data assimilation
	daz                   the gridpoint increment in the azimuthal
	                       direction (degrees)
	drad                  the gridpoint increment in the radial
	                       direction (meters)
	dzed                  the gridpoint increment in the z
	                       direction (meters)
	inner_rad             the radius of the inner cylinder of the
	                       annulus (meters)
	outer_rad             the radius of the outer cylinder of the
	                       annulus (meters)
	depth                 the overall depth of the fluid (meters)
	delta_t               the model integration time step (in seconds)
	time_step_days        the number of days in an integration time step
	time_step_seconds     the number of seconds in an integration time step.
	                       this is not real time, this is time scales by the
	                       tank's rotation rate.  f=0.5 mean a "day" is 4sec.
	                       equate 4sec to 86400sec and determine the dart
	                       time step

	There are various arrays, vectors and types defined
	to handle mapping between the 1d control vector and the
	associated 3d state array, and to handle grid definitions.

		o subroutine static_init_model

		Here, space is allocated for the various grid and
		prognostic variable vectors and arrays.  The locations
		of the model state variables are defined, and the
		model time_step is sorted out.  The annulus time step
		is on the order of 0.1 seconds, a time step not supported
		by DART.  To address this problem, the model time step is
		scaled by the tank's rotati rate (one tank revolution is
		defined as one day), and the associated time step is
		determined.  For example, f0 = 0.5 means \Omega=0.25,
		or 1 day is 4 seconds.  For a dt of 0.1, a model time
		step is 1/40th of a day.  There are 86400 seconds in a
		day, so a dart "second" becomes 1/40th of 86400 = 2160.

		o subroutine comp_dt

		Empty.  Is meaningless when model is integrated off line.

		o subroutine init_conditions

		Empty.  Is meaningless when model is integrated off line.

		o subroutine adv_1step

		Empty.  Is meaningless when model is integrated off line.

		o subroutine model_interpolate

		Didn't do anything here as for the moment am
		concentrating on identity obs.  This will have to 
		be sorted out before real observations can be used.

		o subroutine get_state_meta_data

		Given an integer index into the state vector structure,
		this routine returns the assocated 3d-location.  All the
		heavy lifting for this routine is done once in the
		static_init_model subroutine.

		o subroutine model_get_close_states

		I tried hard to get this subroutine to work, but in the
		interest of time I ended up going with the default brute
		force approach.  My efforts still reside in the 
		subroutine, but are commented out.
	
		o subroutine vector_to_prog_var

		This subroutine takes in the control vector and
		splits it into 3d model variable fields.  It is used
		by the nc_write_model_vars routine to put the state
		into netCDF files in a sensible form.

		o function nc_write_model_atts

		All kinds of stuff was added to this routine in order
		to define the output files for the control variables.

		o function nc_write_model_vars

		The MITgcm annulus uses the C-grid, and the current 
		configuration is passing five prognostic variables to 
		DART.  The routine "vector_to_prog_var" pulls the 
		prognostic variables from the control vector and places 
		them into 3d variables that are output to netCDF.

~/DART/models/MITgcm_annulus/shell_scripts

	o byteswap.c

	For reasons I don't fully understand, it is necessary to do
	all kinds of byte swapping on the MITgcm restart files.  The
	associated executable is called by advance_model.csh.

	o advance_ens.csh

	This script is copied down from 
	~/DART/shell_scripts/advance_ens_fisher_oneproc.csh, and as
	the name implies, it is the script that is called by DART 
	to advance the ensemble offline.

	o makestuff.csh

	This script contains all mkmf and make commands that are
	necessary for building the MITgcm annulus DART distribution.
	Note that it does not contain commands for building the
	MITgcm executable.

	o advance_model.csh

	This script is called by advance_ens.csh and advances each
	ensemble member individually.  The basic idea is that each
	ensemble member is run by the same MITgcm executable, but in
	a working directory that is defined by the ensemble number.

	o coseq.pl

	This script generates a file that is redirected into
	create_obs_sequence.  The benefit of this script is you
	don't have to enter tens of thousands of pieces of
	observational information to create_obs_sequence by
	hand.  It takes in the spacing between observations
	and the observational error covariance for each of the
	variables passed to DART, and makes sure that no
	observations pop up in the middle of the ice bucket!

~/DART/models/MITgcm_annulus/work

	o path_names_create_fixed_network_seq

	Various paths had to be altered in order to point to
	the MITgcm_annulus directory, the annulus obs_kind
	directory, and the annulus location_mod directory.

	o path_names_filter

	Various paths had to be altered in order to point to
	the MITgcm_annulus directory, the annulus obs_kind
	directory, and the annulus location_mod directory.

	o path_names_create_obs_sequence

	Various paths had to be altered in order to point to
	the MITgcm_annulus directory, the annulus obs_kind
	directory, and the annulus location_mod directory.

	o path_names_perfect_model_obs

	Various paths had to be altered in order to point to
	the MITgcm_annulus directory, the annulus obs_kind
	directory, and the annulus location_mod directory.

	o path_names_MITgcm_to_dart

	Various paths had to be altered in order to point to
	the MITgcm_annulus directory, the annulus obs_kind
	directory, and the annulus location_mod directory.

	o path_names_dart_to_MITgcm

	Various paths had to be altered in order to point to
	the MITgcm_annulus directory, the annulus obs_kind
	directory, and the annulus location_mod directory.

	o path_names_perfect_ics

	Various paths had to be altered in order to point to
	the MITgcm_annulus directory, the annulus obs_kind
	directory, and the annulus location_mod directory.

	o mkmf_MITgcm_to_dart

	Had to construct the mkmf file for this new program.

	o mkmf_dart_to_MITgcm

	Had to construct the mkmf file for this new program.

	o mkmf_perfect_ics

	Had to construct the mkmf file for this new program.

EXAMPLE

1) Obtain MITgcmDART.tar and ens.tgz and place them on a filesystem with 
   lots of space (pretend that directory is called $LOTSOFSPACE).  At 
   the time of writing, these two files can be found at

   http://wind.mit.edu/~hansen/MITgcmDART.tar
   http://wind.mit.edu/~hansen/ens.tgz

2) Create a subdirectory called MITgcm, and move MITgcmDART.tar to that
   subdirectory

   > mkdir $LOTSOFSPACE/MITgcm
   > cd MITgcm
   > mv ../MITgcmDART.tar .

3) Unpack the MITgcm

   > tar xvf MITgcmDART.tar 

4) Compile the MITgcm

   > cd verification/osse/build  
   > ../../../tools/genmake -mods=../code
   > make depend
   > make

5) Copy the big initial ensemble to the relevant directory
   ($LOTSOFSPACE/MITgcm/verification/osse/da) and unpack using 
   the relevant script.  Note that mkens.DART defaults to a 
   maximum of 30 ensemble members.  You will have to alter the
   script to support a larger ensemble size.

   > cd ../da # now in $LOTSOFSPACE/MITgcm/verification/osse/da
   > mv $LOTSOFSPACE/ens.tgz .
   > ./mkens.DART

6) Move to the DART MITgcm annulus work directory (here am assuming
   it is a subdirectory off of your home directory)

   > cd ~/DART/models/MITgcm_annulus/work

7) Create a link to the MITgcm distribution

   > ln -s $LOTSOFSPACE/MITgcm MITgcm

8) Copy contents of shell_scripts into work directory

   > cp ../shell_scripts/* .

9) Copy relevant adance_ens script from DART distribution

   > cp ~/DART/shell_scripts/advance_ens_fisher_oneproc.csh .
   > mv advance_ens_fisher_oneproc.csh advance_ens.csh

10) Build the byte swapping utility (and remove the code so that
    subsequent make calls don't accidentally include it).

    > gcc byteswap.c
    > mv a.out byteswap
    > rm byteswap.c

11) Compile all the DART stuff

    > ./makestuff.csh

12) The MITgcm DART distribution comes with model initial conditions.
    It is necessary to translate those initial conditions into something
    DART-consumable.

    > cp MITgcm/verification/osse/da/00/assimilate/pickup.in .
    > cp MITgcm/verification/osse/da/00/assimilate/pickup_nh.in .
    > ./byteswap pickup.in pickup.in.swap -w 8
    > ./byteswap pickup_nh.in pickup_nh.in.swap -w 8
    > ./trans_perfect_ics
    > rm pickup*

13) The MITgcm initial condition is already spun up, but to keep things
    consistent with other DART examples, we'll do a short spin up.
    To get a model initial condition "on the attractor" have to begin
    by constructing observation definitions. 
    [See http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/DAI/Fiji_release.html for explaination]

    > ./create_obs_sequence

	1000  		# upper bound on num obs for memory allocation
	0		# creating a definition
	0		# no quality control necessary
	0		# have some obs info to input
	-3		# means an identity obs at model component 3
	0, 43200	# see comments on time below
	100000000	# obs error variance (ignore obs)
	-1		# no more obs info to enter
	set_def.out	# input file name

    > ./create_fixed_network_seq

	set_def.out 	# input filename
	1		# regularly repeating time sequence
	100		# number of observations in sequence
	0, 43200	# time of initial ob in sequence in days and seconds
	0, 43200 	# period of obs in days and seconds
	obs_seq.in	# file name for output of obs_sequence

    Time doesn't really have any meaning with the current (July 2004)
    implementation of the MITgcm annulus for DART.  The number of
    timesteps between observions is hardcoded in the MITgcm (although
    scripts can (and will) be easily written to make this more variable.
    An additional problem is that DART does not support timesteps
    shorter than one minute.  The timestep for the annulus is 0.1
    seconds, so it was necessary to scale time (for the purpose of
    DART) with respect to the annulus rotation rate.  The current
    hard-coded time between observations within the MITgcm is 2
    seconds.  This is half a "day" according to an f value of 0.5,
    thus, the observation period of 43200 seconds (12 hours) above.

14) Construct the namelist file that will be modified throughout the
    example:

    > cp input.nml.perfect_model_obs_default input.nml
    > cat input.nml.filter_default >> input.nml

    This places both the perfect_model_obs namelist and the filter
    namelist into the same file.

15) Edit the namelist so that a random initial condition is propagated
    forward for a period of time and allowed to fall onto the attractor.

    In input.nml, set output_restart to .true. and start_from_restart
    to .true. under &perfect_model_obs_nml.  Also set async = 2 so that 
    DART knows to advance the model off line.

16) Run perfect_model_obs (this takes around 30 mintues on fisher)

    > ./perfect_model_obs

17) Before running the filter to generate our initial ensemble, it
    is necessary to play some games with the MITgcm restart files.
    DART is passed only a subset of the restart information needed
    by the MITgcm, and the extra information is stored in the
    da/QQ/assimilate/pickup*.* files.  One must take case to ensure
    that the pickup files are consistent with the information being
    passed by DART.  If one were to blindly run filter at this stage,
    ensemble member 01 would have pickup information consistent with
    the end of the perfect_model_obs (t=50 days) run rather than the 
    beginning of the perfect_model_obs run (t=0 days).  We will still 
    need the pickup information at t=50 days, so that will be saved
    before restoring the t=0 pickup information in da/01/assimilate.

    > cd MITgcm/verification/osse/da
    > mkdir store_50
    > cd store_50
    > mkdir truth
    > cd truth
    > cp ../../01/assimilate/pickup* .
    > cd ../..
    > cp 02/assimilate/pickup* 01/assimilate
    > cd ../../../..

18) Edit the namelist to get ready for the initial ensemble generation.

    In input.nml, set start_from_restart to .false., output_restart to 
    .true., and num_output_state_members to 20 under &filter_nml.  Also
    set async = 2 so the filter knows that the model is being advanced
    off line, and set num_output_state_members to zero to conserve
    disk space.  Set restart_in_file_name to perfect_ics.

19) Run the filter to generate the ensemble.  The filter is still using
    the observation information set in item 13 (1 ob every 12 hours with 
    an error variance of 100000000.0).  This means that the observation is
    ignored, and filter generates an ensemble spread across the attractor.
    Spinning up this initial ensemble takes a good 10-12 hours on fisher.

    > ./filter

20) Copy the resulting truth and ensemble restart files to initial
    condition files.

    > cp perfect_restart perfect_ics
    > cp filter_restart filter_ics

21) The MITgcm/verification/osse/da directories now contain pickup
    information at time t=50days which is consistent with the new
    perfect_ics and filter_ics files.  Because we are likely to want
    to go back to these ics for various experiments we need to store
    the ensemble restart information.  Remember from item 17 above that
    the truth pickup files were stored in
    MITgcm/verification/osse/da/store_50/truth.  We now want to save
    the ensemble pickup files in 
    MITgcm/verification/osse/da/store_50/ensemble directories.

    > cd MITgcm/verification/osse/da/store_50
    > mkdir ensemble
    > cd ensemble
    > bash
    > for i in 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20; do
       mkdir $i
       cp ../../$i/assimilate/pickup.in $i
       cp ../../$i/assimilate/pickup_nh.in $i
       cp ../../$i/assimilate/pickup.out $i
       cp ../../$i/assimilate/pickup_nh.out $i
      done
    > exit
    > cd ..

    Obviously, the for loop will have to be as long as the number of
    ensemble members.

22) The next step is to generate a trajectory of observations, so 
    it is necessary to restore the "truth" pickup files in the
    MITgcm tree.  From 21 above, we are already in the
    MITgcm/verification/osse/da/store_50 directory.

    > cp truth/* ../01/assimilate
    > cd cd ../../../../..

23) The initial ensemble and associated truth state have been generated.
    Time to do some real data assimilation.  The process begins by 
    specifying the observation information.  The first step is to run
    create_obs_sequence.  Since create_obs_sequence requires the user to
    enter observation location and error variance information by hand,
    a script called coseq.pl has been constructed to ease the process.
    coseq.pl generates a file that can be input to create_obs_sequence.
    Instead of entering each location and variance, the user enters
    the spacing between observations and a single observation error
    variance that is applied to all observations of a specified type.

    > ./coseq.pl

	50			# spacing between U observations
	0.00000025		# U observation error variance
	50			# spacing between V observations
	0.00000025		# V observation error variance
	50			# spacing between W observations
	0.00000025		# W observation error variance
	50			# spacing between T observations
	0.01			# T observation error variance
	50			# spacing between P observations
	0.00000000000001	# P observation error variance

24) Redirect results of coseq.pl to create_obs_sequence

    > ./create_obs_sequence < coseq.dat

25) Generate the observation sequence using create_fixed_network_seq

    > ./create_fixed_network_seq

	set_def.out	# observation set definition file
	1		# regularly spaced obs in time
	10		# number of observation times
	50, 0		# first observation at day 50
	0, 43200	# observations every 12 hours
	obs_seq.in	# output file for obs sequence definition

    Remember, the chosen start time and observation period
    are scaled by the rotation rate of the tank; they do not
    represent physical time.  Also, remember that the observation
    period is currently hard coded in the MITgcm.

26) Produce the observations described by create_obs_set_def and
    create_obs_sequence using perfect_model_obs.

    > ./perfect_model_obs

27) Since truth was propagated forward in da/01/assimilate
    to generate the observations, it is necessary to restore
    the pickup files in da/01/assimilate back to t=50 days
    for ensemble member 1

    > cd MITgcm/verification/osse/da
    > cp store_50/ensemble/01/* 01/assimilate
    > cd ../../../..

28) Adjust the namelist to do proper data assimilation.

    In input.nml under &filter_nml, make sure async = 2, 
    cutoff = 0.06, cov_inflate = 1.1, start_from_restart=.true.
    restart_in_file_name="filter_ics", and num_output_state_members=20.

29) Run the filter to do the DA

    > ./filter

30) The bits of matlab below can be used to see how the DA performed.
