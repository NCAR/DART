Overview
========

This document describes the DART interface module for the MPAS-Atmosphere (or
briefly, MPAS-ATM) global model, which uses an unstructured Voronoi grid mesh,
formally Spherical Centriodal Voronoi Tesselations (SCVTs). This allows for both
quasi-uniform discretization of the sphere and local refinement. The MPAS/DART
interface was built on the SCVT-dual mesh and does not regrid to regular lat/lon
grids. In the C-grid discretization, the normal component of velocity on cell
edges is prognosed; zonal and meridional wind components are diagnosed on the
cell centers. We provide several options to choose from in the assimilation of
wind observations as shown below.

The grid terminology used in MPAS is as shown in the figure below:

|MPAS_grid_structure|

The wind options during a DART assimilation are controlled by combinations of 4
different namelist values. The values determine which fields the forward
operator uses to compute expected observation values; how the horizontal
interpolation is computed in that forward operator; and how the assimilation
increments are applied to update the wind quantities in the state vector.
Preliminary results based on real data assimilation experiments indicate that
performance is better when the zonal and meridional winds are used as input to
the forward operator that uses Barycentric interpolation, and when the
prognostic *u* wind is updated by the incremental method described in the figure
below. However there remain scientific questions about how best to handle the
wind fields under different situations. Thus we have kept all implemented
options available for use in experimental comparisons. See the figure below for
a flow-chart representation of how the 4 namelist items interact:

|WindDA_options|

Cycling of MPAS/DART is run in a *restart* mode. As for all DART experiments,
the overall design for an experiment is this: the DART program ``filter`` will
read the initial condition file, the observation sequence file, and the DART
namelist to decide whether or not to advance the MPAS-ATM model. All of the
control of the execution of the MPAS model is done by DART directly. If the
model needs to be advanced, ``filter`` makes a call to the shell to execute the
script ``advance_model.csh``, which is ENTIRELY responsible for getting all the
input files, data files, namelists, etc. into a temporary directory, running the
model, and copying the results back to the parent directory (which we call
CENTRALDIR). The whole process hinges on setting the MPAS-ATM model namelist
values such that it is doing a restart for every model advance. Unlike MPAS-ATM
free forecast runs, the forecast step in MPAS/DART requires to set up one more
namelist parameter called ``config_do_DAcycling = .true.`` in ``&restart``
section of ``namelist.input`` to recouple the state vectors (updated by filter)
with the mass field for the restart mode. For more information, check the
``advance_model.csh`` script in ``./shell_scripts/`` directory.

Since DART is an ensemble algorithm, there are multiple analysis files for a
single analysis time: one for each ensemble member. Because MPAS/DART is run in
a restart mode, each member should keep its own MPAS restart file from the
previous cycle (rather than having a single template file in CENTRALDIR).
Creating the initial ensemble of states is an area of active research.

Namelist
========

This namelist is read from the file *input.nml*. Namelists start with an
ampersand '&' and terminate with a slash '/'. Character strings that contain a
'/' must be enclosed in quotes to prevent them from prematurely terminating the
namelist.

The ``&mpas_vars_nml`` namelist within ``input.nml`` contains the list of MPAS
variables that make up the DART state vector. The order the items are specified
controls the order of the data in the state vector, so it should not be changed
without regenerating all DART initial condition or restart files. These
variables are directly updated by the filter assimilation.

Any variables whose values cannot exceed a given minimum or maximum can be
listed in ``mpas_state_bounds``. When the data is written back into the MPAS
NetCDF files values outside the allowed range will be detected and changed. Data
inside the DART state vector and data written to the DART diagnostic files will
not go through this test and values may exceed the allowed limits. Note that
changing values at the edges of the distribution means it is no longer
completely gaussian. In practice this technique has worked effectively, but if
the assimilation is continually trying to move the values outside the permitted
range the results may be of poor quality. Examine the diagnostics for these
fields carefully when using bounds to restrict their values.

Grid Information
================

As the forward operators use the unstructured grid meshes in MPAS-ATM, the
DART/MPAS interface needs to read static variables related to the grid structure
from the MPAS ATM 'history' file (specified in ``model_analysis_filename``).
These variables are used to find the closest cell to an observation point in the
cartesian coordinate (to avoid the polar issues).

model_mod Variable Storage
==========================

The ``&mpas_vars_nml`` within ``input.nml`` defines the list of MPAS variables
used to build the DART state vector. Combined with an MPAS analysis file, the
information is used to determine the size of the DART state vector and derive
the metadata. To keep track of what variables are contained in the DART state
vector, an array of a user-defined type called "progvar" is available with the
following components:

.. code-block:: fortran

   type progvartype
      private
      character(len=NF90_MAX_NAME) :: varname
      character(len=NF90_MAX_NAME) :: long_name
      character(len=NF90_MAX_NAME) :: units
      character(len=NF90_MAX_NAME), dimension(NF90_MAX_VAR_DIMS) :: dimname
      integer, dimension(NF90_MAX_VAR_DIMS) :: dimlens
      integer :: xtype         ! netCDF variable type (NF90_double, etc.) 
      integer :: numdims       ! number of dimensions - excluding TIME
      integer :: numvertical   ! number of vertical levels in variable
      integer :: numcells      ! number of cell locations (typically cell centers)
      integer :: numedges      ! number of edge locations (edges for normal velocity)
      logical :: ZonHalf       ! vertical coordinate for mass fields (nVertLevels)
      integer :: varsize       ! variable size (dimlens(1:numdims))
      integer :: index1        ! location in dart state vector of first occurrence
      integer :: indexN        ! location in dart state vector of last  occurrence
      integer :: dart_kind
      character(len=paramname_length) :: kind_string
      logical  :: clamping     ! does variable need to be range-restricted before 
      real(r8) :: range(2)     ! lower and upper bounds for the data range.
      logical  :: out_of_range_fail  ! is out of range fatal if range-checking?
   end type progvartype

   type(progvartype), dimension(max_state_variables) :: progvar

The variables are simply read from the MPAS analysis file and stored in the
DART state vector such that all quantities for one variable are stored
contiguously. Within each variable; they are stored vertically-contiguous for
each horizontal location. From a storage standpoint, this would be equivalent
to a Fortran variable dimensioned x(nVertical,nHorizontal,nVariables). The
fastest-varying dimension is vertical, then horizontal, then variable ...
naturally, the DART state vector is 1D. Each variable is also stored this way
in the MPAS analysis file.

Compilation
===========

The DART interface for MPAS-ATM can be compiled with various fortran compilers
such as (but not limited to) gfortran, pgf90, and intel. It has been tested on a
Mac and NCAR IBM supercomputer (yellowstone).


.. note::

   While MPAS requires the PIO (Parallel IO) and pNetCDF (Parallel NetCDF)
   libraries, DART uses only the plain NetCDF libraries. If an altered NetCDF
   library is required by the parallel versions, there may be incompatibilities
   between the run-time requirements of DART and MPAS. Static linking of one or
   the other executable, or swapping of modules between executions may be
   necessary.

Conversions
===========

A Welcome Development
---------------------

MPAS files no longer beed to be converted to DART formatted files, they can be
read in directly from a input file list!

Analysis File NetCDF header
---------------------------

The header of an MPAS analysis file is presented below - simply for context.
Keep in mind that **many** variables have been removed for clarity. Also keep
in mind that the multi-dimensional arrays listed below have the dimensions
reversed from the Fortran convention.
