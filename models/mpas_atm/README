Hints for porting a new model to DART:

copy this template directory into a DART/models/xxx
directory for your new model.

if the coordinate system for the model is 1d, you're ok as-is.
if model coordinates are 3d, edit the work/path_names_* files
and change location/oned/* to location/threed_sphere/*

edit all the work/path_names_* files and change models/template/xxx
to use the name of the directory for your model.

try ./quickbuild.csh and everything should compile at this point.

the required subroutines are these:
public :: get_model_size,         &
          adv_1step,              &
          get_state_meta_data,    &
          model_interpolate,      &
          get_model_time_step,    &
          end_model,              &
          static_init_model,      &
          init_time,              &
          init_conditions,        &
          nc_write_model_atts,    &
          nc_write_model_vars,    &
          pert_model_state,       &          
          get_close_maxdist_init, &
          get_close_obs_init,     &
          get_close_obs,          &
          ens_mean_for_model

in addition, model_mod can contain subroutines that are used
for other utility programs and we recommend at least the following
routines be added to model_mod.f90:

public :: model_file_to_dart_vector, &     ! converter
          dart_vector_to_model_file, &     ! converter
          get_gridsize,              &     ! called by everyone
          get_model_filename,        &     ! called by both (set_model_filename?)
          get_state_time,            &     ! model_to_sv, static_init_model
          set_state_time  !(?)             ! sv_to_model, trans_time


edit the model mod and fill in the routines in this order:

1. static_init_model() - make it read in the grid information
  and the number of variables that will be in the state vector
 (fill in the progvar derived type).   fill in the model_size
  variable.  as part of this work, fill in the get_gridsize() 
  code.

  after number 1 is done, get_model_size() and 
  get_model_time_step() from the template should be ok as-is.

2. model_file_to_dart_vector() - given a model data file, read in
  the fields and put them into the 1D DART state vector.  make
  sure the order and values match the progvar array.  

3. dart_vector_to_model_file() - do the reverse of the previous step.

4. get_state_meta_data() - given an index number into the state vector
    return the location and type.  the code which loops over the
    progvar should already do the type, but code to compute what
    lon, lat, and vertical (for a 3d model) or x location (1d)
    corresponds to this item must be written.

5. model_interpolate() - given a location (lon/lat/vert in 3d, x in 1d)
   and a state KIND_xxx kind, return the interpolated value the field
   has at that location.   this is probably one of the routines that
   will take the most code to write.

6. nc_write_model_atts(), nc_write_model_vars() - when filter runs
   it calls these routines to output model data into a netcdf diagnostic
   file which is unrelated to the model data files.  it is possible to
   have the ensemble data just be dumped as a single 1D vector but
   that makes the files less useful.  generally it's most useful to
   put the grid info and dump each variable from the state vector
   into a separate netcdf variable.  the diagnostic files contain the
   ensemble mean, the ensemble stddev, the inflation information, and
   then optionally some or all of the individual ensemble members.

for now, ignore these routines:
   get_close_maxdist_init()
   get_close_obs_init()
   get_close_obs()
   ens_mean_for_model()
   end_model()
 
if you have data in a dart initial condition/restart file, then you
can ignore these routines:
   init_time()
   init_conditions()
otherwise, have them return an initial time and an initial default
ensemble state.

if your model is NOT subroutine callable, you can ignore this routine:
   adv_1step()
otherwise have it call the interface to your model and add the files
necessary to build your model to all the work/path_names_* files.
add the model source to a src/ directory.

if you want to let filter add gaussian noise to a single state vector
to generate an ensemble, you can ignore this routine
   pert_model_state()
otherwise fill in code that does whatever perturbation makes sense
to have an initial ensemble of states.  in some cases that means
adding a different range of values to each different field in the
state vector.

at this point you should have enough code to test and run simple
experiments.  the 'model_mod_check' utility program can be used 
during this process to check your implementation.

the general flow is:

   ./model_to_dart - read model data and convert it into a dart state vector file
   ./create_obs_sequence - make a file with a single observation in it
   ./perfect_model_obs - should interpolate a value for the obs
   ./dart_to_model - convert the dart vector back into a model data file

   generate an ensemble of states, or set 'start_from_restart' to .false.
   run ./filter with the single observation 
   look at the preassim.nc and analysis.nc files
      diff them with ncdiff:  ncdiff analysis.nc preassim.nc Innov.nc
      plot it, with ncview if possible:  ncview Innov.nc
      the difference between the two is the impact of that single observation
      see if it's at the right location and if the differences seem reasonable
