This directory contains the interface code and the shell scripts to
run the MPAS-ATM atmospheric model with DART ensemble data assimilation.

The 'work' directory is where the executables are built.
Run './quickbuild.sh' to compile all the executables.
'./quickbuild.sh nompi' builds the serial versions only,
'./quickbuild.sh' is the default and builds MPI (parallel) versions
of the filter and any other executables that can run on multiple CPUs.

The 'shell_scripts' directory contains a collection of scripts that 
support the workflow for cycling.  The ensemble of MPAS-ATM models have 
to run to advance the time, then 'filter' runs to do data assimilation 
on the ensemble of MPAS restart files, then the ensemble of MPAS models 
advances again, then 'filter' runs, in a cycle.

The 'data' directory contains a single small example MPAS-ATM restart
file along with some stream files for an MPAS run.  See the README.txt
for more details.

Here are more details on how the information in the input and output
files are handled in a cycling experiment.

Very many thanks to Soyoung Ha (NCAR/MMM) and Ryan Torn (U Albany) for 
developing and documenting these scripts.
