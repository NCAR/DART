# How to create an initial mpas ensemble

1) If you have access to an ensemble of grib files, then in the
models/mpas_atm/shell_scripts directory are:

driver_initial_ens.csh
init_mpas_grib.csh

which will convert an ensemble of grib files to an ensemble
of mpas files.

2) If you do not have an ensemble of grib files but do have a single
mpas file (either an initial or a restart file in netcdf), you can 
create an ensemble with features built into the filter program itself.

Set these parameters in input.nml.

&filter_nml
perturb_from_single_instance = .true.

&model_nml
model_perturbation_amplitude = 0.0001  	# set a small but non-zero value

And make sure these parameters in &filter_nml:

input_state_file_list    = 'filter_in.txt'
output_state_file_list   = 'filter_out.txt'

have your single mpas filename in the filter_in.txt file,
and have N filenames in the filter_out.txt file, one per
line for each ensemble member. 

(You can check models/mpas_atm/README for an example.)

A single observation or a small set of observations in the obs sequence
format can be set up in &filter_nml:

obs_sequence_in_name = 'obs_seq.1obs'

Here the observation time in the obs sequence file should be matched with the 
model time in the mpas file in 'filter_in.txt'.

Run filter, which will perturb your single mpas file in filter_in.txt for 
all the states listed as mpas_state_variables in &mpas_vars_nml in your input.nml,
then write out N ensemble members as listed in filter_out.txt.
