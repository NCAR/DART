The MITgcm_ocean model needs a bunch of input files.
Peruse the namelists in the 'data*' files and make sure that 
all the files mentioned live in the 'MITgcm_ocean/inputs' directory.

To allow DART to control the model advances, a couple things have to be
coordinated.

#1 - data: &PARM03 : startTime = 0
     DART:advance_model.csh reformats its state vector (trans_sv_pv) and 
     renames the files to be those declared by the variables in &PARM05.

#2 - data: &PARM03 : endTime = xxxx
     This is fundamentally the assimilation period. The model stops
     after xxxx seconds. DART reads the &PARM03 namelist and uses
     'endTime' as the 'model_time_step'. Given the time from the DART
     initial conditions (or input.nml:filter_nml:init_time_[days,seconds])
     the model may be advanced in 'steps' of 'endTime'. Observations 
     within +/- half of 'endTime' (centered at the current time) are 
     assimilated.

#3 - The ocean code was compiled as a parallel executable to use 20 MPI tasks.
     in SIZE.h ... the nprocs for the latitudes was 5 (we needed 225 lats)
     and 4 for the longitudes (we needed 256). There are some magic '20's 
     floating around and ONLY ASYNC == 4 WAS TESTED. At present,
     async = 2 is guaranteed not to work without modifications to the 
     job.simple.csh and advance_model.csh scripts.

     Because the code and datasets were configured to run for the Gulf of Mexico
     (we had to start somewhere) the following boundary conditions,
     forcing, and namelist files are needed to advance the model - with or 
     without DART. Some of them are pretty big and consequently are not part
     of the DART code tree. Contact Tim Hoar thoar 'at' ucar . edu to get
     the rest of the input datasets.
