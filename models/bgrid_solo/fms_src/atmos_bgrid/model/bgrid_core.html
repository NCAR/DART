<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
<!-- BEGIN OVERVIEW -->
<PRE>

     The basic driver module for the B-grid atmospheric dynamical core.
     This version can be run on distributed memory machines.

</PRE>
</A><!-- END OVERVIEW -->
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------->
<A NAME="DESCRIPTION">
<!-- BEGIN DESCRIPTION -->
<PRE>
     The B-grid dynamical core updates the tendencies of the 
     prognostic variables, the variables themselves are not modified.
     The prognostic variables are surface pressure, the zonal and 
     meridional momentum components, temperature, and optional
     tracers. Specific humidity is considered a tracer.

     This version of the B-grid dynamics use a two time level scheme.
     The gravity waves are integrated using a forward-backward scheme
     with a relatively short time step and the advection terms are
     integrated using a modified Euler backward scheme and longer
     time step. Horizontal diffusion is done on the advective time step.

     Derived-type variables for the horizontal and vertical constants
     must be initialized before initializing the B-grid dynamical core.
     The initialization routine of the B-grid dynamical core returns
     a derived-type variable that is needed when updating the tendencies
     of the prognostic dynamical variables. These prognostic variables
     are also contained as a derived-type variable.

     Here is a detailed write-up of the finite differencing used in the

        A derived-type variable that contains grid constants, time step information,
        and other pre-computed terms that are needed by the dynamical core.
        This includes other derived-type variables and pointers to the physical
        grids of the model, but does not include the prognostic variables.

   <a href="#bgrid_core_init">bgrid_core_init</a>
        Initializes the derived-type variable, bgrid_dynam_type, and initializes
        other modules used. There is no namelist for bgrid_core_mod, all runtime
        options are controlled with optional arguments to this subroutine.
        This subroutine must be called before update_bgrid_core.

OPTIONAL INPUT  (Note: These argument can be modified through a
                        namelist interface in the bgrid_core_driver_mod)

   damp_order_vel       The horizontal damping order for momentum,
   damp_order_tmp       temperature, and default order for all 
   damp_order_trs       prognostic tracers. The damping order must be 
                        an even number; damp_order = 0 turns off damping.
                           <FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR="#000099">[integer, default: damp_order = 4]</FONT>

   damp_coeff_vel       The horizontal damping coefficients for
   damp_coeff_tmp       momentum, temperature, and default value for
   damp_coeff_trs       all prognostic tracers. The coefficients are
                        expressed as non-dimensional values for the 
                        second-order diffusion operator (range = 0,1). 
                           <FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR="#000099">[real, default: damp_coeff = 0.50]</FONT>

   damp_scheme          Determines how horizontal damping coefficients
                        vary with latitude.
                           = 1, constant
                           = 2, varies as inverse of diagonal grid distance
                           = 3, varies as inverse of x-axis grid distance
                        Note: damp_scheme = 1 is recommended, 
                        damp_scheme = 2,3 is experimental.
                            <FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR="#000099">[integer, default: damp_scheme = 1]</FONT>



   damp_slope_corr_vel  The topography slope correction applied to horizontal
   damp_slope_corr_tmp  damping of momentum and temperature (including all
                        prognostic tracers).  The coefficients (with range = 0,1)
                        are expressed as arrays of size 4.  The first 3 values are
                        coefficients for the lowest 3 model layers, the last value
                        represents the remaining uppermost layers.  A NON-ZERO
                        value turns the correction ON.  Typical values might be
                        (/ .25, .50, .75, .95 /).

   advec_order_vel      The advection order for momentum, temperature,
   advec_order_tmp      and default order for all prognostic tracers.
   advec_order_trs      The advection order must be an even number.
                           <FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR="#000099">[integer, default: advec_order = 2]</FONT>

   advec_coeff_vel      Coefficients for modified Euler-backward advection
   advec_coeff_tmp      scheme for momentum, temperature, and all
   advec_coeff_trs      prognostic tracers.
                        NOTE: advec_coeff=0 is the Euler-forward scheme which
                        is unstable, advec_coeff=1 is the Euler-backward scheme
                        which is highly dissipative.
                           <FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR="#000099">[real, default: advec_coeff = 0.7]</FONT>

   num_horiz_fill       The number of successive horizontal and vertical passes
   num_vert_fill        applied in the tracer borrowing/filling scheme.  This
                        conservative scheme is used to fill negative tracer values.
                        It is applied in either the vertical and horizontal directions.
                        Each successive pass should remove more negative values,
                        however an optimum number of passes is probably between 1-3.
                        This is applied after advection to all prognostic tracers.
                           <FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR="#000099">[integer, default: num_fill = 1]</FONT>

   grid_sep_coeff       Coefficient to suppress grid-separation problem
                        associated with the B-grid. Currently, this option has been
                        disabled within the model, so that this coefficient does nothing.
                           <FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR="#000099">[real, default: grid_sep_coeff = 0.00]</FONT>

   filter_option        Determines how polar filtering is performed.
                        filter_option = 0,  NO filtering
                                      = 1,  not implemented

                                            and momentum
                           <FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR="#000099">[integer, default: filter_option = 2]</FONT>

   filter_weight        Weight applied to the polar filter that will
                        increase (or decrease) the strength of the standard
                        polar filter response function.
                        SS(new) = SS(std)**filter_weight,
                        where SS(std) is the Arakawa and Lamb response function.
                           <FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR="#000099">[integer, default: filter_weight = 1 ]</FONT>

   ref_lat_filter       The reference latitude at which polar filtering
                        (in each hemisphere) will begin to be applied.
                        Setting this argument &gt;= 90. will turn off
                        polar filtering.
                           <FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR="#000099">[real, default: ref_lat_filter = 60.]</FONT>

   num_sponge_levels    Number of uppermost model level where a band-pass
                        filter is applied to damp undesirable waves.
                        Currently num_sponge_levels &gt; 1 is not allowed.
                        If num_sponge_levels = 0, no damping is done.
                           <FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR="#000099">[integer, default: num_sponge_levels = 0 ]</FONT>

   sponge_coeff_vel     Damping coefficients for the sponge layer(s) in
   sponge_coeff_tmp     the uppermost model levels. Coefficients have been
   sponge_coeff_trs     normalized and must be in the range [0,1].
                        If num_sponge_levels = 0, the value of the coefficients
                        is ignored.  There is no option to specify coefficients
                        that vary with level, although currently
                        num_sponge_levels &gt; 1 is not allowed.
                           <FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR="#000099">[real, default: sponge_coeff = 0.]</FONT>

   dry_model            Flag that determines whether or not water vapor effects
                        are included in the hydrostatic equation.
                           <FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR="#000099">[logical, default: dry_model = true]</FONT>

   verbose              Flag that control additional printed output.
                        Currently, this option is not being used.
                          <FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR="#000099">[integer, default: verbose = 0]</FONT>
