Overview
========

DART interface module for the dynamical core of the GFDL AM2 Bgrid model. This
model is subroutine callable from DART and can be run in a similar fashion to
low-order models that produce diagnostic output files with multiple assimilation
times per file.

The Bgrid model was originally configured as a comprehensive atmospheric model
as described in Anderson et al. (2004). [1]_

All of that code remains in the directories under the
``DARTHOME/models/bgrid_solo`` directory, however, much of the capability has
been disabled by code modification. What is left is a dry dynamical core for a
model with no dirunal cycle at equinox with forcing described in Held and Suarez
(1994). [2]_

The default settings are for a model with a 60x30 horizontal grid and 5 vertical
levels. This is close to the smallest version that has somewhat realistic
baroclinic instability resulting in mid-latitude 'storm tracks'. The model
resolution can be changed with the entries in the ``bgrid_cold_start_nml``
namelist described in the `Namelist`_ section. It may be necessary to change the
model time step to maintain stability for larger model grids. The model state
variables are the gridded surface pressure, temperature, and u and v wind
components.

The ``bgrid_solo`` directory has a ``work/workshop_setup.csh`` script that compiles 
and runs an example. This example is intended to demonstrate that the same
process used for a low-order model may be used for a much more 
complex model and generates output for state-space or observation-space diagnostics. 

Some examples of ways in which this model can be configured and modified to test
DART assimilation capabilities are documented in Anderson et al. (2005). [3]_

Several programs that generate interesting observation sequences are available
in the ``DARTHOME/models/bgrid_solo`` directory. These programs take
interactive user input and create a text file that can be piped into program
``create_obs_sequence`` to create obs_sequence files. These can serve as
examples for users who are interested in designing their own custom obs_sequence
files.

Program ``column_rand`` creates an obs_sequence with randomly located columns of
observations (essentially synthetic radiosondes) that observe surface pressure
along with temperature and wind components at all model levels.

Program ``id_set_def_stdin`` generates an obs_sequence file that observes every
state variable with error variance of 10000 for surface pressure and 1.0 for
temperature and wind components.

Program ``ps_id_stdin`` generates an obs_sequence that observes every surface
pressure variable for the default model size (30x60) with an error variance of
100.

Program ``ps_rand_local`` generates a set of randomly located surface pressure
observations with an interactively specified error variance. It also allows the
observations to be confined to a rectangular subdomain.

Namelist
========

The ``&model_nml`` namelist is read from the ``input.nml`` file. Namelists
start with an ampersand ``&`` and terminate with a slash ``/``. Character
strings that contain a ``/`` must be enclosed in quotes to prevent them from
prematurely terminating the namelist.

|                      |                    | state vector. The first column is the     |

The Held-Suarez forcing details can be modified with the ``hs_forcing_nml``
namelist using the documentation in Held and Suarez (1994).

Model dynamics can be adjusted with the bgrid_core_driver_nml following the
documentation in the references and internal documentation in the bgrid code.
