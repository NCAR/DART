These are everyones sourcemods for cesm1_1_1 ... 

Each file has the parent filename near the top of the modified file so you can check
the differences. 

The cesm1_1_1 POP build namelist mechanism had a bug in it.
Use the one for cesm1_2_beta04 instead. This can be accomplished (amazingly) by
putting the build-namlist in our SourceMods/src.pop2 section.
