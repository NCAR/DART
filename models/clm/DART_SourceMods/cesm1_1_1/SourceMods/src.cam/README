This atm_comp_mod.F90 forces CAM to use the CAM initial conditions file while 
all other model components are using restart files. This allows us to use 
CONTINUE_RUN = TRUE, but this also means we have to write out CAM restart 
files because we need to use the information CAM sends to the coupler to 
avoid lagging the ocean by a day. At present, this atm_comp_mod.F90 has
some debug statements in it, and will not work properly (I suspect) if we
do not stop at midnight only. This is an interim product.
