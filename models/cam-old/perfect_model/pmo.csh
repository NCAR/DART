# Script to run perfect_model_obs to generate synthetic observations
#    from multiple obs_seq.in files. 
#
# The CENTRAL directory needs to have:
#    caminput_0.nc
#    clminput_0.nc
#    input_X.nml   X = the first obs_seq to be processed. (Used in input_X.nml name)
#    perfect_ic
#    cam_phis.nc   (DART as of 1/2008)
# The following will be retrieved from $CAM_src if necessary
#     advance_model.csh
#     perfect_model_obs
#     run-cam.csh
#     trans_pv_sv
#     trans_sv_pv
#     trans_time
#
# You need to know which of several batch systems you are using.  The most
# common one is LSF.   PBS is also common.  (POE is another but is
# not supported directly by this script.  It is not recommended that you have a
# parallel cluster without a batch system (it schedules which nodes are assigned
# to which processes) but it is possible to run that way -- you have to do
# more work to get the information about which nodes are involved to the 
# parallel tasks -- but anyway, there is a section below that uses ssh and no
# batch.
#
# How to submit this job:
#  1. Look at the #BSUB or #PBS sections below and adjust any of the parameters
#     on your cluster.  Queue names are very system specific; some systems 
#     require wall-clock limits; some require an explicit charge code.
#  2. Submit this script to the queue:
#        LSF:   bsub < pmo.csh
#        PBS:   qsub pmo.csh
#       NONE:   pmo.csh
#
# The script moves the necessary files to the current directory and then
# starts 'perfect_model_obs' as a single-threaded job; 
#
# This central directory is where the scripts reside and where script and 
# program I/O are expected to happen.
