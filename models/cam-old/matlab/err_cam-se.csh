# This is the least inappropriate place for this script.  It uses no matlab,
# but generates files for input to the CAM-SE matlab processor, PlotCubedSpherePatches_eps.m.

# A script to generate the difference between CAM-SE or DART output and the cam_Truth.nc 
# from a perfect model run.
# It should be run in a directory where the output from CAM-SE+DART is living:
#    $case/archive/rest/$date   for CAM-SE initial files
#    $case/archive/dart/hist    for P{oste}rior_Diag.nc files
