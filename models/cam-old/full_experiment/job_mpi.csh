# job.csh ... Script to run whole assimilation experiment; multiple obs_seq.out files. 
# Resulting series of jobs can take days to run, depending on the numbers of: 
#  > observation sequence files (each is a separate job and may be queued), 
#  > model state variables ( sum of # of fields x # of grid points) 
#  > ensemble members (multiplies the state vector size). 
#  > observations (tens to hundreds of thousands / assim time are common),
#  > processors requested (most efficient machine use is # processors = # ensemble members). 
#
#
# You need to know which of several batch systems you are using.  The most
# common one is LSF.   PBS is also common.  (POE is another but is
# not supported directly by this script.  It is not recommended that you have a
# parallel cluster without a batch system (it schedules which nodes are assigned
# to which processes) but it is possible to run that way -- you have to do
# more work to get the information about which nodes are involved to the 
# parallel tasks -- but anyway, there is a section below that uses ssh and no
# batch.
#
# How to submit this job:
#  1. Look at the #BSUB or #PBS sections below and adjust any of the parameters
#     on your cluster.  Queue names are very system specific; some systems 
#     require wall-clock limits; some require an explicit charge code.
#  2. Submit this script to the queue:
#        LSF:   bsub < job_mpi.csh
#        PBS:   qsub job_mpi.csh
#       NONE:   job_mpi.csh
#
# The script moves the necessary files to the current directory and then
# starts 'filter' as a parallel job on all nodes; each of these tasks will 
# call some a separate model_advance.csh when necessary.
#
# This central directory is where the scripts reside and where script and 
# program I/O are expected to happen.
