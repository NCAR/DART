# Saves restart files to MSS. CAM/CLM/ICE, and filter.

# THIS VERSION is intended to work with the new HPSS system instead of the

#### LSF options for BSUB
### -J      job name    (master script job.csh presumes filter.xxxx.log)
### -o      output listing filename 
### -P      account number
### -q      queue
### -n      number of tasks (processors)
### -x      exclusive use of node
### -R "span[ptile=(num procs you want on each node)]"
