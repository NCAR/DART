This README was last updated June 25, 2004 by Jim Hansen.  The
Lorenz 04 model was originally implemented in the Fiji release of
DART.  This README has been modified for the Guam release.

This file describes the Lorenz 04 model (L2k4, hereafter) and
its current implementation within the DART framework.

o For details on the L2k4 model, read the MODEL section
  below.
o For specifics on how L2k4 was implemented in the DART
  framework, read the DART section below.
o For a step-by-step tutorial on how to use the model in 
  DART, read the EXAMPLE section below.

MODEL

As of the production of this README, L2k4 had not yet
appeared in the literature.  A manuscript entitled "Designing
Chaotic Models" is in preparation for JAS by Ed Lorenz.

L2k4 is the Model III described in the above manuscript.  It 
represents an evolution of the Lorenz 96 model and permits 
multiple spatial and temporal scales in a single integrated
variable.  This removes the limitation of the Lorenz 96 model
where neighboring gridpoints were almost uncorrelated, and
permits experiments that address representativeness error and
resolution error.

The model equations are given by

      dZ_i
      ---- = [X,X]_{K,i} + b^2 (-Y_{i-2}Y_{i-1} + Y_{i-1}Y_{i+1})
       dt                +  c  (-Y_{i-2}X_{i-1} + Y_{i-1}X_{i+1})
                         -  X_i - b Y_i + F,

where

     [X,X]_{K,i} = -W_{i-2K}W_{i-K}
                 +  sumprime_{j=-(K/2)}^{K/2} W_{i-K+j}X_{i+K+j}/K,

      W_i =  sumprime_{j=-(K/2)}^{K/2} X_{i-j}/K,

and sumprime denotes a special kind of summation where the first
and last terms are divided by 2.

NOTE: The equations above are only valid for K even.  If K is odd,
then sumprime is replaced by the traditional sum, and the K/2 limits
of summation are replaced by (K-1)/2. THIS CODE ONLY IMPLEMENTS THE
K EVEN SOLUTION!!!
 
The variable that is integrated is Z, but the integration requires
the variables X and Y.  They are obtained by
      
      X_i = sumprime_{j= -J}^{J} a_j Z_{i+j}
      Y_i = Z_i - X_i.

The "a" coefficients are given by

      a_j = alpha - beta |j|,
                 
where
      
      alpha = (3J^2 + 3)/(2J^3 + 4J)
      beta  = (4J^2 + 2)/(2J^4 + 4J^2).
 
This choice of alpha and beta ensures that X_i will equal Z_i
when Z_i varies quadratically over the interval 2J.   This choice 
of alpha and beta means that sumprime a_j = 1 and
sumprime (j^2) a_j = 0.
 
Note that the impact of this filtering is to put large-scale
variations into the X variable, and small-scale variations into   
the Y variable.
      
The parameter names above are based on those that appear in
Lorenz 04.  To map to what is used in the DART code, set:

       F = forcing
       b = space_time_scale
       c = coupling
       K = K     
       J = smooth_steps

DART

Few changes were necessary to implement L2k4 in DART.  Because
of the similarity between the Lorenz 96 model and L2k4, the
Lorenz 96 implementation was replicated and L2k4-specific changes 
were made.  Details are given below.  There were no additional
modifications to make to the L2k4-specific changes when migrating
from Fiji to Guam.  There were scripting changes that were 
required.

~/DART/models/lorenz_04/model_mod.nml

	L2k4-relevant parameters were added to the namelist.
	These include a new model size, a new forcing, and a
	new \delta t.  In addition, parameters to set the 
	model's space-time scale, coupling strength, averaging 
	length scale, and smoothing length scale were added. 

~/DART/models/lorenz_04/model_mod.f90

	module model_mod: added the new namelist defaults,
	defined a vector used for the production of X and Y
	from Z in the z2xy subroutine, and defined a few
	parameters that are used to make the comp_dt and z2xy
	subroutines more efficient.

	subroutine static_init_model(): provided values for
	the vector used in the production of X and Y from
	Z in the z2xy subroutine, and provided values for
	the parameters used to make the comp_dt and z2xy
	subroutines more efficient.

	subroutine comp_dt(z, dt): this is an all-new 
	derivatives file that is unique to L2k4.  The model
	equations are described above in the MODEL section,
	and are also described in the comp_dt subroutine.

	subroutine z2xy(z,x,y): this is a new subroutine that
	is needed by the comp_dt subroutine.  It takes in a
	Z vector and decomposes it into X and Y.

	function nc_write_model_atts( ncFileID ): added
	L2k4-specific parameter values to the netCDF attributes.

~/DART/models/lorenz_04/work/

	It was necessary to set the lorenz_04 path in each of
	the path_name_* files to point to the correct model_mod.f90.

~/DART/models/lorenz_04/shell_scripts/

	The four *.s files and the *.pl file must be copied
	to the ../work directory.

	The four *.s files perform the mkmf for each of the four
	programs (create_fixed_network_seq, create_obs_sequence, 
	perfect_model_obs, and filter), and perform the relevant 
	makes.  

	In order the scripts should be executed:

	1) ./csh_fix.s
	2) ./csh_seq.s
	3) ./csh_perf.s
	4) ./csh_filt.s

	coseq.pl: This perl script can be used in conjunction with 
	create_obs_sequence.  It generates a file called coseq.dat
	that contains the information one would have to enter via
	the keyboard to create_obs_sequence, but instead of having
	to type in all those variances and component numbers, one
	only need enter the spacing between observations and the
	variance in the observational errors.  The script assumes
	that the first observation location is always component
	number 1, and that all observations have the same error
	variance.  Once coseq.dat has been generated, it is passed 
	to create_obs_sequence by:

	./create_obs_sequence < coseq.dat

~/DART/matlab/

	A lorenz_04 case was added to the relevant matlab files.
	No other changes were necessary.

EXAMPLE

1)  Move into the L2k4 work directory:

    > cd DART/models/lorenz_04/work

2)  Copy scripts into work directory:

    > cp ../shell_scripts/csh_*.s .
    > cp ../shell_scripts/coseq.pl .

3)  Do all the necessary mkmf'ing and make'ing

    > ./csh_fix.s
    > ./csh_seq.s
    > ./csh_perf.s
    > ./csh_filt.s

4)  To get a model initial condition "on the attractor" have to begin
    by constructing observation definitions. 
    [See http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/DAI/Fiji_release.html for explaination]

    > ./create_obs_sequence

	100000000	# upper bound on num obs for memory allocation
	0		# creating a definition
	0		# no quality control necessary
	0		# have some obs info to input
	-3		# means an identity obs at model component 3
	0, 0		# time has no meaning since will run fixed_network
	100000000	# obs error variance (ignore obs)
	-1		# no more obs info to enter
	set_def.out	# input file name

    > ./create_fixed_network_seq

	set_def.out 	# input filename
	1		# regularly repeating time sequence
	100		# number of observations in sequence
	3, 0		# time of initial ob in sequence in days and seconds
	3, 0 		# period of obs in days and seconds
	obs_seq.in	# file name for output of obs_sequence

    The DART default is to set a single model integration time step to
    3600 seconds (one hour).  Setting an observatin period of 3 days 
    simply means there are 72 model time steps (0.001*72 = 0.072 model
    time units) between observations.  Note that this default can be
    changed in the Guam release through the time_step_days and 
    time_step_seconds parameters.

5)  Construct the namelist file that will be modified throughout the
    example:

    > cp input.nml.perfect_model_obs input.nml
    > cat input.nml.filter >> input.nml

    This places both the perfect_model_obs namelist and the filter
    namelist into the same file.

6)  Edit the namelist so that a random initial condition is propagated
    forward for a period of time and allowed to fall onto the attractor.

    In input.nml, set output_restart to .true. under &perfect_model_obs_nml

7)  Run perfect_model_obs

    > ./perfect_model_obs

8)  Copy the resulting restart file into an initial condition file:

    > cp perfect_restart perfect_ics

9)  Edit the namelist to reflect the new initial conditions.

    In input.nml, set start_from_restart to .true. under
    &perfect_model_obs_nml

10) Generate another long run of the model, this time starting from the
    initial condition just generated by perfect_model_obs instead of from
    a random initial condition.  The initial ensemble will be generated
    with respect to this trajectory in a couple steps.

    > ./perfect_model_obs

11) Edit the namelist to get ready for the ensemble generation.

    In input.nml, set start_from_restart to .false., output_restart to 
    .true., and num_output_state_members to 20 under &filter_nml.

12) Run the filter to generate the ensemble.  The filter is still using
    the observation information set in item 4 (1 ob every 3 days with an
    error variance of 100000000.0).  This means that the observation is
    ignored, and filter generates an ensemble spread across the attractor.

    > ./filter

13) Move the resulting truth and ensemble restart files to initial
    condition files.

    > cp perfect_restart perfect_ics
    > cp filter_restart filter_ics

14) The initial ensemble and associated truth state have been generated.
    Time to do some real data assimilation.  The process begins by 
    specifying the observation information.  The first step is to run
    create_obs_sequence.  Since create_obs_sequence requires the user to
    enter observation location and error variance information by hand,
    a script called coseq.pl has been constructed to ease the process.
    coseq.pl generates a file that can be input to create_obs_sequence.
    Instead of entering each location and variance, the user enters
    the spacing between observations and a single observation error
    variance that is applied to all observations.

    > ./coseq.pl

	10		# spacing between observations
	1.0		# observation error variance

15) Redirect results of coseq.pl to create_obs_sequence

    > ./create_obs_sequence < coseq.dat

16) Generate the observation sequence using create_fixed_network_seq

    > ./create_fixed_network_eq

	set_def.out	# observation set definition file
	1		# regularly spaced obs in time
	100		# number of observation times
	3, 0		# first observation at day 3
	3, 0		# observations every three days
	obs_seq.in	# output file for obs sequence definition

    Remember, 3 days has no physical significance.  All it means
    in this context is 72 model integration time steps.

17) Produce the observations described by create_obs_set_def and
    create_obs_sequence using perfect_model_obs.

    > ./perfect_model_obs

18) Adjust the namelist to do proper data assimilation.

    In input.nml, set cutoff to 0.1, cov_inflate to 1.1, 
    start_from_restart to .true., and restart_in_file_name
    to filter_ics under &filter_nml.

19) Run the filter to do the DA

    > ./filter

20) The usual matlab scripts can be run to view the results
    of the data assimilation.  In addition, the bits of matlab
    below can be used to see how the DA performed:

% load the true trajectory and the analysis ensembles
clear;pack
ncload('true_state.nc');
truth(:,:)=state(:,1,:);
ncload('analysis.nc');

% plot ensemble mean analysis and truth at end of run
