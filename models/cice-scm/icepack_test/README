This test case performs DART data assimilation with CICE_SCM (Icepack)

The assimilation is performed within a single time window, and therefore the model is never advanced.

This example uses 10 ensemble members, which are created by perturbing the single restart file iced.2011-01-02-00000.nc to generate the ensemble.

Note that the model time has been set to match the time of the observations with the following values in the &filter_nml:
   init_time_days               = 153076,
   init_time_seconds            = 0,

The observation sequence contains 300 observations, 100 for each of the following types:
   SAT_SEAICE_AGREG_CONCENTR
   SAT_SEAICE_AGREG_THICKNESS
   SAT_SEAICE_AGREG_SNOWDEPTH
