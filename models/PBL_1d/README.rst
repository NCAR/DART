Overview
========

The PBL_1D directory has been deprecated in favor of using the WRF/DART model
interface.  There is now support for WRF single column mode built into the
standard model_mod in that directory.

If you are interested in more information on this configuration, please email
us at dart@ucar.edu.

If you really want the files that used to be in this directory, check them out
from the Kodiak release of DART.
