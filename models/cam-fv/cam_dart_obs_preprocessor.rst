program ``camdart_obs_preprocessor``
====================

Overview
--------

This program provides a way to modifiy the incoming observation stream before running filter
for the CAM model.  Currently runs with the CAM-FV variant.  It uses the CAM model_mod namelist
to select the CAM level above which to remove observations.  The output obs_seq file contains
all observations below that level and none above.

This program could be extended to superob dense obs, adjust obs error values near the surface,
or any other desired changes to the incoming observation stream.

|

Usage
-----

Set the input and output obs_seq filenames in the namelist and run.

|

Namelist
--------

This namelist is read from the file ``input.nml``. Namelists start with an ampersand '&' and terminate with a slash '/'.
Character strings that contain a '/' must be enclosed in quotes to prevent them from prematurely terminating the
namelist.

Items in this namelist set the input and output files.

Discussion
----------

See the documentation in the obs_kind and obs_def modules for things you can query about an observation, and how to set
(overwrite) existing values.

| 

Building
--------

This program will be built when ``models/cam-fv/work/quickbuild.sh`` is run.

The ``preprocess`` program must be built and run first to define what set of observation types will be supported. See
the :doc:`../../../assimilation_code/programs/preprocess/preprocess` for more details on how to define the list and run
it. The ``&preprocess_nml`` namelist in the ``input.nml`` file must contain files with definitions for the combined set
of all observation types which will be encountered over all input obs_seq files.

If you have observation types which are not part of the default list in the &preprocess_nml namelist, add them to the
input.nml file and then run quickbuild.sh.
