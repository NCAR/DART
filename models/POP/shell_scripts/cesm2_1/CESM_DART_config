# Purpose
# ---------------------
#
# This script integrates DART with a pre-existing CESM multi-instance case.
# It must be run from a valid CASEROOT directory. If the case was created
# using one of the DART scripts, this script should be staged in the
# CASEROOT directory automatically, and DARTROOT is set at that time.
#
# POP is the only active model component.
# CESM starts and stops to allow for POP to assimilate every 24 hours.
#
# This script will build the DART executables if they are not found.
#
# There are many CESM binary files in big-endian format, and DART reads
# some of them, so you MUST compile DART accordingly e.g.,
# ifort -convert big_endian
# Contact dart@ucar.edu if you want to use another compiler.
#
# ---------------------
# How to set up the script
# ---------------------
#
# -- Ensure DARTROOT references a valid DART directory.
# -- Examine the whole script to identify things to change for your experiments.
# -- Provide any initial files needed by your run:
#       inflation
#       sampling error correction
# -- Run this script.
# -- Edit the DART input.nml that appears in the ${CASEROOT} directory.
# -- Submit the job using ${CASEROOT}/case.submit
#
# ==============================================================================
# Get the environment of the case - defines number of instances/ensemble size ...
# Each model component has their own number of instances.
# ==============================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Check the DART configuration:

1) The default behavior is to _not_ invoke DART and simply run CESM.
   We recommend that you make sure this works before proceeding.

2) To turn DART on or off, while in ${CASEROOT}  execute:
   ./xmlchange --value DATA_ASSIMILATION_OCN=[TRUE,FALSE] 

3) Modify what you need to in the DART namelist file, i.e. ${CASEROOT}/input.nml

4) If you have recompiled any part of the DART system, 'stage_dart_files'
   will copy them into the correct places.

5) If you stage your own inflation files, make sure you read the "INFLATION" section
   in ${CASEROOT}/assimilate.csh. At the very least, copy your inflation files
   in ${RUNDIR} into the appropriate names:
      ${CASE}.pop.output_priorinf_mean.nc
      ${CASE}.pop.output_priorinf_sd.nc
      ${CASE}.pop.output_postinf_mean.nc 
      ${CASE}.pop.output_postinf_sd.nc   
   and remove the ${RUNDIR}/pop_inflation_cookie file. If that file remains,
   your initial inflation values will come from the namelist! The staged files
   should be 'output' as the logic of assimilate.csh renames the output of the
   previous assimilation cycle to be reused as the input for next cycle.  

   If assimilate.csh does not find inflation files, it will call fill_inflation_restart
   to create some from the inflation values in input.nml.

6) Make sure the observation directory names in assimilate.csh or perfect_model.csh
   matches the one on your system.

7) Submit the CESM job in the normal way.

8) You can use ${CASEROOT}/stage_cesm_files to stage an ensemble of files
   to restart a run at a date for which you have a restart set.

9) You can run multiple forecast/assimilation cycles in a single job by
   setting the DATA_ASSIMILATION_CYCLES xml variable. To perform 4 cycles
   in a single job - specify:
   ./xmlchange --value DATA_ASSIMILATION_CYCLES=4
   make sure you give the job enough wallclock to finish all 4 cycles,
   and be prepared for your RUNDIR to be very full.
