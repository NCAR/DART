# Resource file for use when running CESM (POP specifically) and DART.
# This file has all the configuration items needed and will be copied
# into the CASEROOT directory to be used during an experiment.

# ==============================================================================
# Options defining the experiment:
#
# CASE          The value of "CASE" will be used many ways; directory and file
#               names both locally and (possibly) on the HPSS, and script names;
#               so consider its length and information content.
# compset       Defines the vertical resolution and physics packages to be used.
#               Must be a standard CESM compset; see the CESM documentation.
# case_string   A unique string used to name a given case.
# resolution    Defines the horizontal resolution and dynamics; see CESM docs.
# cesmtag       The version of the CESM source code to use when building the code.
# cesmtagmajor  The major release version of CESM, used to identify the
#               appropriate CESM directory.
# 
# To create a variant compset, see the CESM documentation and carefully
# incorporate any needed changes into this script.
# ==============================================================================

# There are SourceMods that enable POP to recompute the barotropic velocity
# to prevent the barotropic solver from crashing.
# SourceMods may be handled in one of two ways. If you have your own git clone of
# the repository, you may simply commit your changes to your git repo and 
# set use_SourceMods = FALSE . If you prefer to keep your changes separate 
# (as was required under svn), please put your SourceMods in a directory with 
# the following structure (which is intended to be similar to the structure 
# in the CLM distribution):
#
# ${SourceModDir}/src.pop
#                |-- forcing.F90
#                |-- initial.F90
#                |-- overflows.F90

# Directories:
# cesmdata     Location of some supporting CESM data files.
# cesmroot     Location of the CESM code base.
# caseroot     Defines the CESM case directory - where the CESM+DART
#              configuration files will be stored.  This should probably not
#              be on a fileystem that is scrubbed.
#              This script WILL DELETE any existing caseroot, so this script,
#              and other useful things should be kept elsewhere.
# rundir       Defines the location of the CESM run directory.  Will need large
#              amounts of disk space, generally on a scratch partition.
# exeroot      Defines the location of the CESM executable directory , where the
#              CESM executables will be built.  Medium amount of space
#              needed, generally on a scratch partition.
# archdir      Defines the location of the CESM short-term archive directories.
#              Files remain here until the long-term archiver moves them to 
#              permanent storage.  Requires large amounts of disk space. Should
#              not be on a scratch partition unless the long-term archiver is 
#              invoked to move these files to permanent storage.
