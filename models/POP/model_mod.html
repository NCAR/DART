<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>The <strong>Parallel Ocean Program (POP)</strong> may now be used with the 
   <strong>Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART)</strong>.
   Both main variants - <a href="http://climate.lanl.gov/Models/POP/">LANL POP</a> and
   <a href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm1.0/pop2/">CESM1.0 POP2</a> have been 
   tested. At present (July 2010), we are assimilating salinity and temperature 
   observations from the World Ocean Database (2005) with the intention of switching
   to the World Ocean Database (2009) as needed.
   <br />
   <br />
   The following POP variables are extracted from the POP netCDF restart files and
   are conveyed to DART:
   <em class=code>SALT_CUR</em>,
   <em class=code>TEMP_CUR</em>,
   <em class=code>UVEL_CUR</em>,
   <em class=code>VVEL_CUR</em>, and 
   <em class=code>PSURF_CUR</em>. These variables are then adjusted to be consistent
   with real observations and stuffed back into the same netCDF restart files.
   Since DART is an ensemble algorithm, there are multiple restart files for a 
   single restart time: one for each ensemble member. Creating the initial ensemble
   of ocean states is an area of active research. At present, it may be sufficient
   to use a climatological ensemble; e.g., using the restarts for '1 January 00Z' 
   from 50 consecutive years. Experience has shown that having a paired (unique)
   atmospheric forcing maintains the ensemble spread better than simply forcing
   all the ocean ensemble members with one single atmospheric state.
   <br />
   <br />
   DART reads the grid information for POP from the files specified in 
   POP's <em class=code>&amp;grid_nml</em>.
   When DART is responsible for starting/stopping POP, the information is 
   conveyed through POP's <em class=code>&amp;time_manager_nml</em>. 
</P>

   <h2><a href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm1.0/pop2/">CESM1.0 POP2</a></h2>
   <P>
      was tested and run in production on NCAR's bluefire computer from IBM.
      This implementation is a significant departure from the DART 'business as usual' 
      model in that DART is not responsible for advancing the model - in this case,
      ALL of CESM! Instead, the CESM Interactive Ensemble facility is used to manage 
      the ensemble and the Flux Coupler is responsible for stopping POP at the times 
      required to perform an assimilation. DART simply runs 'end-to-end' at every
      assimilation time, while CESM runs continuously. This is a complete role-reversal
      from the normal DART operation but was relatively simple to implement because
      CESM had infrastructure to exploit. 
      <br />
      <br />
      Several modifications to CESM CASEROOT scripts will be required and will be 
      documented more later in this document.  The 
      <em class=file>DART/models/POP/shell_scripts/</em><em class=program>assimilate.csh</em>
      script is inserted into the CESM run script. The Flux Coupler stops POP every 
      midnight and all the observations within +/- 12 hours are assimilated.
      The observation sequence files have been parsed into 'daylong' chunks and
      have names derived from the date to facilitate manipulation in the UNIX shell.
      <br />
      <br />
      The DART components were built with the following settings:
   </P>
   <pre>
      MPIFC = mpxlf95_r
      MPILD = mpxlf95_r
      FC = xlf90_r
      LD = xlf90_r
      INCS = -I/usr/local/lib64/r4i4 -I/usr/local/include
      LIBS = -L/usr/local/lib64/r4i4 -lnetcdf
      FFLAGS = -qsuffix=f=f90:cpp=F90 -q64 -b64 -qarch=auto -qmaxmem=-1 -O2 $(INCS)

   <h2><a href="http://climate.lanl.gov/Models/POP/">LANL POP</a></h2>
   <P>
      is invoked the same way as any other high-order model.
      <b>Important</b>: This interface was tested with the LANL/POP 2_0_1 version 
      of POP ...  but STILL CANNOT BE USED for assimilation until the POP code is 
      modified to do a forward euler timestep for an 'assimilation' restart.
      <br />
      <br />
      DART is invoked and POP is started/stopped multiple times.
      It was checked in the gx3v5 geometry and POP was built in the 'default' 
      configuration: one which requires no forcing files, no boundary conditions, 
      etc., so I have no idea what to expect when confronting this with real
      observations ...
   </P>
   <pre>
      setenv ARCHDIR linux
      gmake OPTIMIZE=no COUPLED=no
   </pre>
   <P>
      Given the wide range of input files and modes for running POP - 
      the DART scripts will surely have to be modified to accomodate moving
      the boundary/forcing files required for different usage patterns.
      <br />
      <br />
      There are several scripts in the <em class=file>DART/models/POP/shell_scripts</em>
      directory that are employed when using DART to assimilate with a LANL/POP
      model: <em class=program>advance_model.csh</em>,
      <em class=program>run_perfect_model_obs.batch</em>, and
      <em class=program>run_filter.batch</em>&nbsp;. 
      <br />
      <br />
      The DART components compile and run on our Intel-based cluster running SLES10 
      with the ifort 10.1 20090203 compiler with the following flags 
      (the value of NETCDF was appropriate for our system):
   </P>
   <pre>
      MPIFC = mpif90
      MPILD = mpif90
      FC = ifort
      LD = ifort
      INCS = -I$(NETCDF)/include
      LIBS = -L$(NETCDF)/lib -lnetcdf -lmkl -lmkl_lapack -lguide -lpthread
      FFLAGS = -O0 -fpe0 -vec-report0 -assume byterecl $(INCS)
      LDFLAGS = $(FFLAGS) $(LIBS)
   </pre>
   <P>
      Intel-based machines are natively little-endian, so I like to append 
      a ".le" suffix on all binary files.
      <br />
      <br />
      On our machine, with the openmpi framework, it is necessary to specify 
      <em class=file>input.nml</em><em class=code>:&amp;mpi_utilities_nml:reverse_task_layout = .true.,</em >
      to be able to simultaneously run (2) MPI programs on the same set of nodes.

<div class=indent1>
   <h3>Converting between DART files and POP restart files.</h3>
   <P>Only POP netCDF format restart files are supported. Yes, really.
      It gets better.
      Since the POP restart files do not have the actual grid information
      in them, that information must be read from binary files (for the horizontal)
      and an ascii file (for the vertical). Since I'm always working on both
      big- and little-endian machines, I have a devil of a time keeping my
      binary files straight. 
      All of DART/POP is predicated on using pointer files to contain the 
      names of the POP restart netCDF files. It turns out to be really
      useful to dereference the pointer file and link the result to a presumed 
      name for use by the program unit. Otherwise, we were endlessly mucking about
      with trying to dynamically change namelists, etc. in our scripts. Ugly.
      <br />
      <br />
      There are two programs and one module:
   </P>
   <table width="100%" cellpadding="10">
   <tr><td valign="top"><a href="pop_to_dart.html">pop_to_dart.f90</a></td>
       <td>converts the POP restart file <em class=file>pop.r.nc</em> into a 
       DART-compatible file normally called <em class=file>dart_ics</em>&nbsp;.
       There must also be a <em class=file>pop_in</em> namelist for POP
       (since this specifies the names of the grid files). 
       We usually wind up linking the dereferenced
       pointer file name to a static name that is used by DART.
       To that end, <em class=file>rpointer.ocn.restart</em> points to 
       <em class=file>pop.r.nc</em> for this program.
       </td>
   </tr>
   <tr><td valign="top"><a href="dart_to_pop.html">dart_to_pop.f90</a></td>
       <td>inserts the DART output into an existing POP restart netCDF file by
       overwriting the

       <em class=code>UVEL_CUR</em>,
       <em class=code>VVEL_CUR</em>, and 
       <em class=code>PSURF_CUR</em> variables in the POP restart netCDF file.
       There are two different types of DART output files, so there is a namelist
       option to specify if the DART file has two time records or just one 
       (if there are two, the first one is the 'advance_to' time, followed 
       by the 'valid_time' of the ensuing state). <em class=program>dart_to_pop</em>
       requires the POP restart file have a name of <em class=file>pop.r.nc</em>,
       the POP input namelist <em class=file>pop_in</em> must exist, as do the
       geometry files specified by <em class=file>pop_in</em>.
       If the DART file contains an 'advance_to' time, 
       <em class=program>dart_to_pop</em> creates a new 
       <em class=code>&amp;time_manager_nml</em> for POP in a file called
       <em class=file>pop_in.DART</em> which can be used to control the
       length of the POP integration.

<a name="InitialEnsemble"></a>
<div class=indent1>
   <h3>Generating the initial ensemble.</h3>
   <P>
      Creating the initial ensemble of ocean states is an area of active research.
      The POP model cannot take one single model state and generate its own 
      ensemble (typically done with <a href="#pert_model_state">pert_model_state</a>).
      <br />
      <br />
      The ensemble has to come from 'somewhere else'. 
      At present, it may be sufficient to use a climatological ensemble; e.g., 
      using the POP restarts for '1 January 00Z' from 50 consecutive years 
      from a hindcast experiment.
      <br />
      <br />
      There is a <em class=program>shell_scripts/MakeInitialEnsemble.csh</em> 
      script that is intended to demonstrate how to convert a set of POP netCDF 
      restart files into a set of DART files that have a consistent timestamp. 
      If you simply convert each POP file to a DART file using 
      <em class=program>dart_to_pop</em>, each DART file will have a 'valid&nbsp;time'
      that reflects the POP time of that state - instead of an ensemble of states
      reflecting one single time. The
      <a href="../../../utilities/restart_file_utility.f90">restart_file_utility</a> 
      can be used to overwrite the timestep in the header of each DART initial 
      conditions file. The namelist for this program must look something like:
   </P>
   <pre>
   &amp;restart_file_tool_nml
     input_file_name              = "dart_input",
     output_file_name             = "dart_output",
     ens_size                     = 1,
     single_restart_file_in       = .true.,
     single_restart_file_out      = .true.,
     write_binary_restart_files   = .true.,
     overwrite_data_time          = <em class=changed>.true.</em>,
     new_data_days                = <em class=changed>145731</em>,
     new_data_secs                = <em class=changed>0</em>,
     input_is_model_advance_file  = .false.,
     output_is_model_advance_file = .false.,
     overwrite_advance_time       = .false.,
     new_advance_days             = -1,
     new_advance_secs             = -1,
     gregorian_cal                = .true.  /</pre>
   <P>
      The time of days&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em class=changed>145731</em> 
      seconds&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em class=changed>0</em> relates to 00Z&nbsp;1&nbsp;Jan&nbsp;2000 in the DART world.
      <br />
      <br />
      BTW - Experience has shown that having a paired (unique) atmospheric forcing 
      maintains the ensemble spread better than simply forcing all the ocean 
      ensemble members with one single atmospheric state.

   <h3>Generating a set of observations for a 'perfect model' experiment using the LANL/POP executable and scripts.</h3>
   <P>
      A perfectly sensible approach to get to know the system would be to try to 
   </P>
   <ol>
     <li>assimilate data for the first assimilation period and stop. Do not advance
         the model at all. The filter namelist can control all of this and you do
         not need to have a working <em class=program>advance_model.csh</em>

     <li>advance the model first and then assimilate data for the first assimilation

     <li>advance, assimilate and advance again. This tests the whole DART facility.</li>
   </ol>
   <P>
      I always like running something akin to a 'perfect model' experiment to start.
      Since I have not come up with a good way to perturb a single model state to
      generate an ensemble, here's the next best thing. The details for running 
      each program are covered in their own documentation.
   </P>
   <ol>
      <li>Create a set of initial conditions for DART by running one instance of POP 
         for a very long time and saving restart files 'every so often'.
         Use one of these as the initial condition
         for <em class=program>perfect_model_obs</em> and the rest as the
	 ensemble for the assimilation experiment. Since no one in their right 
	 mind would use a high-resolution model for a proof-of-concept case
	 (hint, hint), running a low-resolution model for a 'very long time' should
	 not be a problem.
      </li>

      <li>create a TINY (i.e. 1) set of 'perfect' observations in the normal fashion:
         <a href="../../../obs_sequence/create_obs_sequence.html">create_obs_sequence</a>
         and then 
         <a href="../../../obs_sequence/create_fixed_network_seq.html">create_fixed_network_seq</a>
         to create an empty observation sequence file 
         (usually called <em class=file>obs_seq.in</em>).
	 The programs will prompt you for all the information they require.
	 Read their documentation if necessary.
	 </li>

      <li>break the <em class=file>pop_in</em> namelist that comes with POP into
          two pieces - one called <em class=file>pop_in.part1</em>, 
	  that contains the <em class=code>&amp;time_manager_nml</em> and 
	  put the rest in <em class=file>pop_in.part2</em>. The 
	  <em class=code>&amp;time_manager_nml</em> will be repeatedly updated
	  as the POP model is repeatedly called by 
	  <em class=program>advance_model.csh</em>.

<!-- Description -->

<P>
   This namelist is read in a file called <em class=file>pop_in</em>&nbsp;.
   This namelist is the same one that is used by the ocean model and is used 
   to control the integration length of POP. It is unimportant for the CESM/POP 
   experiments but is critically important for the LANL/POP experiments.
   The values are explained in full in the POP documentation. The DART code
   reads the namelist and simply overwrites several values with the new time
   integration information. All the other values are unchanged. 
   <br />
   <br />
   <em class=program>dart_to_pop</em> writes out a new 
   <em class=code>&amp;time_manager_nml</em> in <em class=file>pop_in.DART</em>
   if the DART state being converted has the 'advance_to_time' record in it.
   This is the case during the middle of a DART experiment, but is not 
   typically encountered if one is working with DART 'initial conditions' 
   or 'restart' files. The <em class=file>pop_in.DART</em> must be concatenated
   with the other namelists needed by POP into a file called 
   <em class=file>pop_in</em>&nbsp;. We have chosen to store the other 
   namelists (which contain static information) in a file called 
   <em class=file>pop_in.part2</em>. Initially, the 
   <em class=code>time_manager_nml</em> is stored in a companion file called 
   <em class=file>pop_in.part1</em> and the two files are concatenated into
   the expected <em class=file>pop_in</em> - then, during the course of an
   assimilation experiment, DART keeps writing out a new 
   <em class=code>time_manager_nml</em> with new integration information - 
   which gets appended with the static information in 
   <em class=file>pop_in.part2</em>&nbsp;
   <br />
   <br />
   If you are running the support programs in a standalone fashion 
   (as you might if you are converting restart files into an intial ensemble),
   the 'valid time' of the model state comes from the restart file 
   -&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;- the namelist. You can always patch the times in the 
   headers with <em class=program>restart_file_utility</em>.
   <br />
   <br />
   Only the namelist variables of interest to DART are discussed. All
   other namelist variables are ignored by DART - but mean something to POP.

</TABLE>

<P>The presence of 'dry' gridpoints causes a little extra work for the
   <em class=program>get_close_obs()</em> routine. The routine normally
   comes from the <em class=program>location_mod</em> which has no notion
   of wet/dry grid cell attributes. As such, the POP 
   <em class=program>model_mod</em> will be augmenting the work done by
   <em class=program>location_mod/get_close_obs()</em>&nbsp;.
   <br />
   <br />
   Fundamentally, the <em class=program>location_mod</em> calculates and returns 
   all the 'close' observations.  DART is designed such that the routine that 
   uses the list of close observations is in <em class=file>model_mod.f90</em>. 
   Consequently, the POP <em class=program>model_mod</em> can take that 
   information and adjust as necessary. This creates some logistical issues 
   in that the POP model_mod needs to intercept all calls to 
   <em class=program>location_mod:get_close_obs()</em> - which can be achieved 
   with the following syntax:
</P>
<pre>
   use location_mod, only : loc_get_close_obs =&gt; get_close_obs
</pre>

coordinate variables (the grid arrays: ULON, ULAT, TLON, TLAT, ZG, ZC, KMT, KMU), 
information from some of the namelists, and either the 1D state 
vector or the prognostic variables (SALT,TEMP,UVEL,VVEL,PSURF). 
All the required information (except for the netCDF file identifier) 
is obtained from the scope of the <em class=program>model_mod</em> module.
Both the <em class=file>input.nml</em> and <em class=file>pop_in</em> files

<div class=indent1> <!-- Description -->
<P>
Given a model state, <em class=code>pert_model_state</em> produces a 
perturbed model state. This is used to generate ensemble initial conditions 
perturbed around some control trajectory state when one is preparing to 
spin-up ensembles.  Since the DART state vector for the POP model 
contains both 'wet' and 'dry' cells, it is imperative to provide an 
interface to perturb <strong>just</strong> the wet cells 
(<em class=code>interf_provided == .true.</em>).
<br />
<br />
The magnitude of the perturbation is wholly determined by 
<em class=file>input.nml</em><em class=code>&amp;model_mod_nml:model_perturbation_amplitude</em>
and <strong>utterly, completely fails</strong>.
<br />
<br />
A more robust perturbation mechanism is needed. 
Until then, avoid using this routine by using your own ensemble of initial conditions. 
This is determined by setting
<em class=file>input.nml</em><em class=code>&amp;filter_nml:start_from_restart = .false.</em>

<P>
Given a DART location (referred to as "base") and a set of locations, and a
definition of 'close' - return a subset of locations that are 'close', as well
as their distances to the DART location and their indices. This routine intentionally
masks a routine of the same name in <em class=program>location_mod</em> because we
want to be able to discriminate against selecting 'dry land' locations.
<br />
<br />
Given a single location and a list of other locations, returns the indices
of all the locations close to the single one along with the number of
these and the distances for the close ones.  The list of locations
passed in via the <em class=code>obs</em> argument must be identical to
the list of <em class=code>obs</em> passed into the most recent call
to <em class=code>get_close_obs_init()</em>.  If the list of locations
of interest changes, <em class=code>get_close_obs_destroy()</em> must
be called and then the two initialization routines must be called
before using <em class=code>get_close_obs()</em> again.
<br />
<br />
For vertical distance computations, the general philosophy is to convert all
vertical coordinates to a common coordinate. This coordinate type is defined
in the namelist with the variable "vert_localization_coord".
